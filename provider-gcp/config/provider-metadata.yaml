            perimeter_type: |4-
                Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
                bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
                and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
                ONE regular Service Perimeter.
                In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                resources share some perimeter . Perimeter
                Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.
                Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                themselves.
                Default value is PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR.
                Possible values are PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR and PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE.
            spec: |4-
                Proposed  ServicePerimeter configuration.
                This configuration allows to specify and test ServicePerimeter configuration
                without enforcing actual access restrictions. Only allowed to be set when
                the useExplicitDryRunSpec flag is set.
                Structure is documented below.

            use_explicit_dry_run_spec: |4-
                Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists
                for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
                Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                configuration  to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config  without
                actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
                bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.

                ONE regular Service Perimeter.
                In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected

                The Cloud Build timeout used as part of any dependent builds performed by version creation. Defaults to 10 minutes.
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: "3.5s".
            config_id: |4-
                Endpoints service configuration ID as specified by the Service Management API. For example "2016-09-19r1".
                By default, the rollout strategy for Endpoints is "FIXED". This means that Endpoints starts up with a particular configuration ID.
                When a new configuration is rolled out, Endpoints must be given the new configuration ID. The configId field is used to give the configuration ID
                and is required in this case.
                Endpoints also has a rollout strategy called "MANAGED". When using this, Endpoints fetches the latest configuration and does not need
                the configuration ID. In this case, configId must be omitted.

            sensitive_params: |4-
                Different parameters are configured primarily using the the params field on this
                resource. This block contains the parameters which contain secrets or passwords so that they can be marked
                sensitive and hidden from plan output. The name of the field, eg: secret_access_key, will be the key
                in the params map in the api request.
                Credentials may not be specified in both locations and will cause an error. Changing from one location
                to a different credential configuration in the config will require an apply to update state.
                Structure is documented below.
            service_account_name: |4-
                Service account email. If this field is set, transfer config will
                be created with this service account credentials. It requires that
                requesting user calling this API has permissions to act as this service account.
            start_time: |4-
                Specifies time to start scheduling transfer runs. The first run will be
                scheduled at or after the start time according to a recurrence pattern
                defined in the schedule string. The start time can be changed at any
                moment. The time when a data transfer can be triggered manually is not
                limited by this option.

                The default encryption key for all tables in the dataset. Once this property is set,
                all newly-created partitioned tables in the dataset will have encryption key set to
                this value, unless table creation request  overrides the key.

                property in the timePartitioning
                settings set to this value, and changing the value will only
                affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will
                have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.
                Setting this property overrides the use of defaultTableExpirationMs
                for partitioned tables: only one of defaultTableExpirationMs and
                defaultPartitionExpirationMs will be used for any new partitioned
                table. If you provide an explicit timePartitioning.expirationMs when
                creating or updating a partitioned table, that value takes precedence
                over the default partition expiration time indicated by this property.
            expirationTime: |-
                property set to the creation time plus
                the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect
                new tables, not existing ones. When the expirationTime for a given
                table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically.
                If a table's expirationTime is modified or removed before the
                table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when
                creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default
                expiration time indicated by this property.

            allow_jagged_rows: |4-
                Accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. The missing values are treated as nulls.
                If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records,
                an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. Only applicable to CSV, ignored for other formats.
            allow_large_results: |4-
                If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, allows the query to produce arbitrarily large result tables at a slight cost in performance.
                Requires destinationTable to be set. For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and large results are always allowed.
                However, you must still set destinationTable when result size exceeds the allowed maximum response size.
            allow_quoted_newlines: |4-
                Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file.

            delete: Default is 20 minutes.
            destination_format: |4-
                The exported file format. Possible values include CSV, NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON and AVRO for tables and SAVED_MODEL for models.
                The default value for tables is CSV. Tables with nested or repeated fields cannot be exported as CSV.
                The default value for models is SAVED_MODEL.
            destination_uris: |4-
                A list of fully-qualified Google Cloud Storage URIs where the extracted table should be written.
            encoding: |4-
                The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1.
                The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data
                has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
            error_result: |-
                Final error result of the job. If present, indicates that the job has completed and was unsuccessful.
                Structure is documented below.
            errors: |-
                The first errors encountered during the running of the job. The final message
                includes the number of errors that caused the process to stop. Errors here do
                not necessarily mean that the job has not completed or was unsuccessful.
                Structure is documented below.
            expiration_ms: |4-
                Number of milliseconds for which to keep the storage for a partition. A wrapper is used here because 0 is an invalid value.
            extract: |4-
                Configures an extract job.
                Structure is documented below.
            field: |4-
                If not set, the table is partitioned by pseudo column '_PARTITIONTIME'; if set, the table is partitioned by this field.
                The field must be a top-level TIMESTAMP or DATE field. Its mode must be NULLABLE or REQUIRED.
                A wrapper is used here because an empty string is an invalid value.
            flatten_results: |4-
                If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, flattens all nested and repeated fields in the query results.
                allowLargeResults must be true if this is set to false. For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and results are never flattened.
            id: an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/jobs/{{job_id}}
            ignore_unknown_values: |4-
                Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema.
                If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records,
                and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
                The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value:
                CSV: Trailing columns
                JSON: Named values that don't match any column names
            inline_code: |4-
                An inline resource that contains code for a user-defined function .
                Providing a inline code resource is equivalent to providing a URI for a file containing the same code.
            job_id: |4-
                The ID of the job. The ID must contain only letters , numbers , underscores , or dashes . The maximum length is 1,024 characters.
            job_timeout_ms: |4-
                Job timeout in milliseconds. If this time limit is exceeded, BigQuery may attempt to terminate the job.
            job_type: The type of the job.
            key_result_statement: |4-
                Determines which statement in the script represents the "key result",
                used to populate the schema and query results of the script job.
                Possible values are LAST and FIRST_SELECT.
            labels: |4-
                The labels associated with this job. You can use these to organize and group your jobs.
            load: |4-
                Configures a load job.
                Structure is documented below.
            max_bad_records: |4-
                The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value,
                an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.
            maximum_billing_tier: |4-
                Limits the billing tier for this job. Queries that have resource usage beyond this tier will fail .
                If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.
            maximum_bytes_billed: |4-
                Limits the bytes billed for this job. Queries that will have bytes billed beyond this limit will fail .
                If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.
            model_id: |4-
                The ID of the model.
            null_marker: |4-
                Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify "\N", BigQuery interprets "\N" as a null value
                when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an
                empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as
                an empty value.
            parameter_mode: |4-
                Standard SQL only. Set to POSITIONAL to use positional  query parameters or to NAMED to use named  query parameters in this query.
            print_header: |4-
                Whether to print out a header row in the results. Default is true.
            priority: |4-
                Specifies a priority for the query.
                Default value is INTERACTIVE.
                Possible values are INTERACTIVE and BATCH.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            projection_fields: |4-
                If sourceFormat is set to "DATASTORE_BACKUP", indicates which entity properties to load into BigQuery from a Cloud Datastore backup.
                Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties.
                If any named property isn't found in the Cloud Datastore backup, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
            quote: |4-
                The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding,
                and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.
                The default value is a double-quote . If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string.
                If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.
            resource_uri: |4-
                A code resource to load from a Google Cloud Storage URI .
            script_options: |4-
                Options controlling the execution of scripts.
                Structure is documented below.
            skip_leading_rows: |4-
                The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data.
                The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.
                When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following:
                skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected,
                the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row.
                skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row.
                skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected,
                row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
            source_format: |4-
                The format of the data files. For CSV files, specify "CSV". For datastore backups, specify "DATASTORE_BACKUP".
                For newline-delimited JSON, specify "NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON". For Avro, specify "AVRO". For parquet, specify "PARQUET".
                For orc, specify "ORC". [Beta] For Bigtable, specify "BIGTABLE".
                The default value is CSV.
            source_model: |4-
                A reference to the model being exported.
                Structure is documented below.

                The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud.
                For Google Cloud Storage URIs: Each URI can contain one '' wildcard character
                and it must come after the 'bucket' name. Size limits related to load jobs apply
                to external data sources. For Google Cloud Bigtable URIs: Exactly one URI can be
                specified and it has be a fully specified and valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table.
                For Google Cloud Datastore backups: Exactly one URI can be specified. Also, the '' wildcard character is not allowed.
            state: Running state of the job. Valid states include 'PENDING', 'RUNNING', and 'DONE'.
            statement_byte_budget: |4-
                Limit on the number of bytes billed per statement. Exceeding this budget results in an error.
            statement_timeout_ms: |4-
                Timeout period for each statement in a script.
            status: |-
                The status of this job. Examine this value when polling an asynchronous job to see if the job is complete.
                Structure is documented below.
            time_partitioning: |4-
                Time-based partitioning specification for the destination table.
                Structure is documented below.
            type: |4-
                The only type supported is DAY, which will generate one partition per day. Providing an empty string used to cause an error,
                but in OnePlatform the field will be treated as unset.
            use_avro_logical_types: |4-
                Whether to use logical types when extracting to AVRO format.
            use_legacy_sql: |4-
                Specifies whether to use BigQuery's legacy SQL dialect for this query. The default value is true.

            use_query_cache: |4-
                Whether to look for the result in the query cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed whenever
                tables in the query are modified. Moreover, the query cache is only available when a query does not have a destination table specified.
                The default value is true.
            user_defined_function_resources: |4-
                Describes user-defined function resources used in the query.
                Structure is documented below.

                allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema.
                If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with
                extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too
                many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.

            interval: ' The width of each range within the partition.'
            kms_key_name: |4-
                 The self link or full name of a key which should be used to
                encrypt this table.  Note that the default bigquery service account will need to have
                encrypt/decrypt permissions on this key - you may want to see the
                google_bigquery_default_service_account datasource and the
                google_kms_crypto_key_iam_binding resource.
            kms_key_version: The self link or full name of the kms key version used to encrypt this table.
            labels: ' A mapping of labels to assign to the resource.'
            last_modified_time: The time when this table was last modified, in milliseconds since the epoch.
            location: The geographic location where the table resides. This value is inherited from the dataset.
            materialized_view: |4-
                 If specified, configures this table as a materialized view.
                Structure is documented below.
            max_bad_records: |-
                The maximum number of bad records that
                BigQuery can ignore when reading data.
            mode: |-

            num_long_term_bytes: The number of bytes in the table that are considered "long-term storage".
            num_rows: The number of rows of data in this table, excluding any data in the streaming buffer.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
                is not provided, the provider project is used.
            quote: |-
                The value that is used to quote data sections in a
                CSV file. If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the
                property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline
                characters, you must also set the allow_quoted_newlines property to true.
                The API-side default is ", specified in Terraform escaped as \". Due to
                limitations with Terraform default values, this value is required to be
                explicitly set.
            range_partitioning: |4-
                 If specified, configures range-based
                partitioning for this table. Structure is documented below.

                "DATSTORE_BACKUP", and "BIGTABLE". To use "GOOGLE_SHEETS"
                the scopes must include
                "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly".
            source_uri_prefix: |-
                When hive partition detection is requested,
                a common for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately
                before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following
                this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro
                gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive
                partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix
                can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/.
                Note that when mode is set to CUSTOM, you must encode the partition key schema within the source_uri_prefix by setting source_uri_prefix to gs://bucket/path_to_table/{key1:TYPE1}/{key2:TYPE2}/{key3:TYPE3}.

                 Specifies whether to use BigQuery's legacy SQL for this view.
                The default value is true. If set to false, the view will use BigQuery's standard SQL.
            view: |4-
                 If specified, configures this table as a view.

                 The instance type to create. One of "DEVELOPMENT" or "PRODUCTION". Defaults to "PRODUCTION".
                It is recommended to leave this field unspecified since the distinction between "DEVELOPMENT" and "PRODUCTION" instances is going away,
                and all instances will become "PRODUCTION" instances. This means that new and existing "DEVELOPMENT" instances will be converted to
                "PRODUCTION" instances. It is recommended for users to use "PRODUCTION" instances in any case, since a 1-node "PRODUCTION" instance
                is functionally identical to a "DEVELOPMENT" instance, but without the accompanying restrictions.

                 The number of nodes in your Cloud Bigtable cluster.
                Required, with a minimum of 1 for a PRODUCTION instance. Must be left unset
                for a DEVELOPMENT instance.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
                is not provided, the provider project is used.
            storage_type: |4-
                 The storage type to use. One of "SSD" or
                "HDD". Defaults to "SSD".
            zone: |4-
                 The zone to create the Cloud Bigtable cluster in. If it not
                specified, the provider zone is used. Each cluster must have a different zone in the same region. Zones that support
                Bigtable instances are noted on the Cloud Bigtable locations page.

            name: |4-
                The resource name.
            note_reference: |4-
                The resource name of a ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Note, created by the
                user. If the Note is in a different project from the Attestor, it
                should be specified in the format projects/*/notes/* . This field may not be updated.
                An attestation by this attestor is stored as a Container Analysis
                ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Occurrence that names a container image
                and that links to this Note.
            pkix_public_key: |4-
                A raw PKIX SubjectPublicKeyInfo format public key.
                NOTE: id may be explicitly provided by the caller when using this
                type of public key, but it MUST be a valid RFC3986 URI. If id is left
                blank, a default one will be computed based on the digest of the DER
                encoding of the public key.

                If this field is non-empty, one of the specified public keys must
                verify that an attestation was signed by this attestor for the
                image specified in the admission request.
                If this field is empty, this attestor always returns that no valid
                attestations exist.

            max_burst_size: |-
                The max burst size.
                Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are
                in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high
                rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits
                resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.

                A task's retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles maxDoublings times,
                then increases linearly, and finally retries retries at intervals of maxBackoff
                up to maxAttempts times.
            max_retry_duration: |4-
                If positive, maxRetryDuration specifies the time limit for
                retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first
                attempted. Once maxRetryDuration time has passed and the task has
                been attempted maxAttempts times, no further attempts will be
                made and the task will be deleted.

                Configuration for manual approval to start a build invocation of this BuildTrigger.
                Builds created by this trigger will require approval before they execute.
                Any user with a Cloud Build Approver role for the project can approve a build.
                Structure is documented below.
            approval_required: |4-
                Whether or not approval is needed. If this is set on a build, it will become pending when run,
                and will need to be explicitly approved to start.
            args: |4-
                A list of arguments that will be presented to the step when it is started.
                If the image used to run the step's container has an entrypoint, the args

                If ignoredFiles and changed files are both empty, then they are not
                used to determine whether or not to trigger a build.
                If ignoredFiles is not empty, then we ignore any files that match any
                of the ignored_file globs. If the change has no files that are outside

                and includedFiles is empty, then as far as this filter is concerned, we
                should trigger the build.
                If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
                and includedFiles is not empty, then we make sure that at least one of
                those files matches a includedFiles glob. If not, then we do not trigger
                a build.

        argumentDocs:
            autoscaling_policy: |4-
                The configuration parameters for the autoscaling algorithm. You can
                define one or more of the policies for an autoscaler: cpuUtilization,
                customMetricUtilizations, and loadBalancingUtilization.
                If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based
                on cpuUtilization to 0.6 or 60%.
                Structure is documented below.
            cooldown_period: |4-
                The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it
                starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents
                the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
                initializing, during which the collected usage would not be
                reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.
                Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
                numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
                instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
                and time the startup process.
            cpu_utilization: |4-
                Defines the CPU utilization policy that allows the autoscaler to
                scale based on the average CPU utilization of a managed instance
                group.
                Structure is documented below.
            create: Default is 20 minutes.
            creation_timestamp: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
            delete: Default is 20 minutes.
            disabled: |4-
                A boolean value that specifies if a scaling schedule can influence autoscaler recommendations. If set to true, then a scaling schedule has no effect.
            duration_sec: |4-
                The duration of time intervals  for which this scaling schedule will be running. The minimum allowed value is 300.
            filter: |4-
                A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                is exporting per-instance or per-group data.
                You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                You can only use direct equality comparison operator  without
                any functions for each selector.
                You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                be identical.
                The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                labels.
                If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.
                If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.
                You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                . If multiple
                TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

                Structure is documented below.
            min_replicas: |4-
                The minimum number of replicas that the autoscaler can scale down
                to. This cannot be less than 0. If not provided, autoscaler will
                choose a default value depending on maximum number of instances
                allowed.
            min_required_replicas: |4-
                Minimum number of VM instances that autoscaler will recommend in time intervals starting according to schedule.
            mode: |4-
                Defines operating mode for this policy.
                Default value is ON.
                Possible values are OFF, ONLY_UP, and ON.
            predictive_method: |4-
                Indicates whether predictive autoscaling based on CPU metric is enabled. Valid values are:
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            scale_down_control: |4-
                Defines scale down controls to reduce the risk of response latency
                and outages due to abrupt scale-in events
                Structure is documented below.
            scale_in_control: |4-
                Defines scale in controls to reduce the risk of response latency
                and outages due to abrupt scale-in events
                Structure is documented below.
            scaling_schedules: |4-
                Scaling schedules defined for an autoscaler. Multiple schedules can be set on an autoscaler and they can overlap.
                Structure is documented below.
            schedule: |4-
                The start timestamps of time intervals when this scaling schedule should provide a scaling signal. This field uses the extended cron format .
            self_link: The URI of the created resource.
            single_instance_assignment: |4-
                If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the
                total amount of work to be done or resource usage, set this value to
                an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
                The autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
                value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                to group resizing.
                For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages
                or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to
                your instances.
                A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
                instead.
            time_zone: |4-
                The time zone to be used when interpreting the schedule. The value of this field must be a time zone name from the tz database: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database.
            type: |4-
                Defines how target utilization value is expressed for a
                Stackdriver Monitoring metric.
                Possible values are GAUGE, DELTA_PER_SECOND, and DELTA_PER_MINUTE.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.
            zone: |4-
                URL of the zone where the instance group resides.

                Structure is documented below.
            client_tls_policy: |4-
                ClientTlsPolicy is a resource that specifies how a client should authenticate
                connections to backends of a service. This resource itself does not affect
                configuration unless it is attached to a backend service resource.

            consecutive_errors: |4-
                Number of errors before a host is ejected from the connection pool. When the
                backend host is accessed over HTTP, a 5xx return code qualifies as an error.
                Defaults to 5.
            consecutive_gateway_failure: |4-
                The number of consecutive gateway failures  before a consecutive
                gateway failure ejection occurs. Defaults to 5.
            consistent_hash: |4-
                Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session
                affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
                policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
                destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
                destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent

                are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
                For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
                endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
                located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
                Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
                Network Endpoint Group backends.
                Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
                partial URL.

                A health check must be specified unless the backend service uses an internet
                or serverless NEG as a backend.
                For internal load balancing, a URL to a HealthCheck resource must be specified instead.
            http_cookie: |4-
                Hash is based on HTTP Cookie. This field describes a HTTP cookie
                that will be used as the hash key for the consistent hash load
                balancer. If the cookie is not present, it will be generated.

                according to query_string_whitelist and
                query_string_blacklist. If neither is set, the entire query
                string will be included.
                If false, the query string will be excluded from the cache
                key entirely.
            interval: |4-

                The max requests per second  of the group.
                Can be used with either RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes,
                but required if RATE mode. For RATE mode, either maxRate or one
                of maxRatePerInstance or maxRatePerEndpoint, as appropriate for
                group type, must be set.
            max_rate_per_endpoint: |4-
                The max requests per second  that a single backend network
                endpoint can handle. This is used to calculate the capacity of

                The minimum number of virtual nodes to use for the hash ring.
                Larger ring sizes result in more granular load
                distributions. If the number of hosts in the load balancing pool
                is larger than the ring size, each host will be assigned a single
                virtual node.
                Defaults to 1024.
            negative_caching: |4-
                Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects.
            negative_caching_policy: |4-
                Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code. negativeCaching must be enabled to configure negativeCachingPolicy.
                Omitting the policy and leaving negativeCaching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache TTLs.

                time period, the response will be revalidated before
                being served.
                When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
                internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
                "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
                existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in
                responses will not be altered.
            subject_alt_names: |4-
                A list of alternate names to verify the subject identity in the certificate.

                detection via success rate statistics is not performed for any host in the
                cluster. Defaults to 5.
            success_rate_request_volume: |4-
                The minimum number of total requests that must be collected in one interval  to include this host in success rate
                based outlier detection. If the volume is lower than this setting, outlier
                detection via success rate statistics is not performed for that host. Defaults
                to 100.
            success_rate_stdev_factor: |4-
                This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier
                ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success
                rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean
                success rate: mean - . This factor is divided
                by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the
                runtime value should be 1900. Defaults to 1900.

            disk_encryption_key: |4-
                Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.
                After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must
                provide the same key if you use the disk later .
                Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
                the disk.
                If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
                the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and
                you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.
                Structure is documented below.
            id: an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/disks/{{name}}
            image: |4-
                The image from which to initialize this disk. This can be
                one of: the image's self_link, projects/{project}/global/images/{image},
                projects/{project}/global/images/family/{family}, global/images/{image},
                global/images/family/{family}, family/{family}, {project}/{family},
                {project}/{image}, {family}, or {image}. If referred by family, the
                images names must include the family name. If they don't, use the
                google_compute_image data source.
                For instance, the image centos-6-v20180104 includes its family name centos-6.
                These images can be referred by family name here.
            interface: |4-
                Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk, which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI.
            label_fingerprint: |-

            multi_writer: |4-
                Indicates whether or not the disk can be read/write attached to more than one instance.
            name: |4-
                Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
                the regular expression [a-z]? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.
            physical_block_size_bytes: |4-
                Physical block size of the persistent disk, in bytes. If not present
                in a request, a default value is used. Currently supported sizes
                are 4096 and 16384, other sizes may be added in the future.
                If an unsupported value is requested, the error message will list
                the supported values for the caller's project.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            provisioned_iops: |4-
                Indicates how many IOPS must be provisioned for the disk.
            resource_policies: |4-
                Resource policies applied to this disk for automatic snapshot creations.
                ~>NOTE This value does not support updating the
                resource policy, as resource policies can not be updated more than
                one at a time. Use
                google_compute_disk_resource_policy_attachment
                to allow for updating the resource policy attached to the disk.
            self_link: The URI of the created resource.
            size: |4-
                Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this
                field when creating a persistent disk using the image or
                snapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty
                persistent disk.
                If you specify this field along with image or snapshot,
                the value must not be less than the size of the image
                or the size of the snapshot.
                ~>NOTE If you change the size, Terraform updates the disk size
                if upsizing is detected but recreates the disk if downsizing is requested.
                You can add lifecycle.prevent_destroy in the config to prevent destroying
                and recreating.
            snapshot: |4-
                The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as
                a partial or full URL to the resource. If the snapshot is in another
                project than this disk, you must supply a full URL. For example, the
                following are valid values:
            source_image_encryption_key: |4-
                The customer-supplied encryption key of the source image. Required if
                the source image is protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.
                Structure is documented below.
            source_image_id: |-
                The ID value of the image used to create this disk. This value
                identifies the exact image that was used to create this persistent
                disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an image
                that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
                image ID would identify the exact version of the image that was used.
            source_snapshot_encryption_key: |4-
                The customer-supplied encryption key of the source snapshot. Required
                if the source snapshot is protected by a customer-supplied encryption
                key.
                Structure is documented below.
            source_snapshot_id: |-
                The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value
                identifies the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent
                disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot
                that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
                snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was
                used.
            type: |4-
                URL of the disk type resource describing which disk type to use to
                create the disk. Provide this when creating the disk.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.

            disabled: |4-
                Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled, i.e not applied to the
                network it is associated with. When set to true, the firewall rule is
                not enforced and the network behaves as if it did not exist. If this
                is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled.

                If defined, logging is enabled, and logs will be exported to Cloud Logging.
                Structure is documented below.
            metadata: |4-
                This field denotes whether to include or exclude metadata for firewall logs.
                Possible values are EXCLUDE_ALL_METADATA and INCLUDE_ALL_METADATA.
            name: |4-
                Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with

            network: |4-
                The name or self_link of the network to attach this firewall to.
            priority: |4-
                Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both
                inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative
                priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of
                priority implies higher precedence . DENY rules take
                precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.

                traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must
                be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and
                sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will
                apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
                source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The
                connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to
                apply. Only IPv4 is supported. For INGRESS traffic, one of source_ranges,
                source_tags or source_service_accounts is required.
            source_service_accounts: |4-
                If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only
                to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this
                list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an
                instance's external IP address because service accounts are associated
                with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the
                same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will
                apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
                source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in
                sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both
                properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be
                used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags. For INGRESS traffic,
                one of source_ranges, source_tags or source_service_accounts is required.
            source_tags: |4-
                If source tags are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic
                with source IP that belongs to a tag listed in source tags. Source
                tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP
                address. Because tags are associated with an instance, not an IP
                address. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If
                both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has
                source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to
                a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need
                to match both properties for the firewall to apply. For INGRESS traffic,
                one of source_ranges, source_tags or source_service_accounts is required.
            target_service_accounts: |4-
                A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the
                network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
                targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or
                sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are
                specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified
                network.
            target_tags: |4-
                A list of instance tags indicating sets of instances located in the
                network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
                If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all
                instances on the specified network.

        argumentDocs:
            all_ports: |4-
                This field can be used with internal load balancer or network load balancer
                when the forwarding rule references a backend service, or with the target
                field when it references a TargetInstance. Set this to true to
                allow packets addressed to any ports to be forwarded to the backends configured
                with this forwarding rule. This can be used when the protocol is TCP/UDP, and it
                must be set to true when the protocol is set to L3_DEFAULT.
                Cannot be set if port or portRange are set.
            allow_global_access: |4-
                If true, clients can access ILB from all regions.
                Otherwise only allows from the local region the ILB is located at.
            backend_service: |4-
                A BackendService to receive the matched traffic. This is used only
                for INTERNAL load balancing.
            create: Default is 20 minutes.
            creation_timestamp: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
            delete: Default is 20 minutes.
            description: |4-
                An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
                you create the resource.
            id: an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/forwardingRules/{{name}}
            ip_address: |4-
                The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
                traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
                the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
                loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
                type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
                to IP address specifications.
                An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
                reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
                reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
                The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
                that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
                For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
                Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
            ip_protocol: |4-
                The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
                When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are
                valid.
                Possible values are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP, and L3_DEFAULT.
            is_mirroring_collector: |4-
                Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used
                as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops,
                instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic
                mirrored even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This
                can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
                loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
            label_fingerprint: |4-
                The fingerprint used for optimistic locking of this resource.  Used
                internally during updates.
            labels: |4-
                Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
            load_balancing_scheme: |4-
                This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can be
                EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, or INTERNAL_MANAGED. EXTERNAL is used for Classic
                Cloud VPN gateways, protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP address,
                and HTTP, SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
                INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,
                and internal TCP/UDP load balancers.
                EXTERNAL_MANAGED is used for regional external HTTP load balancers.
                INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP load balancers.
                Default value is EXTERNAL.
                Possible values are EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, and INTERNAL_MANAGED.
            name: |4-
                Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
                the regular expression [a-z]? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.
            namespace: |4-
                Service Directory namespace to register the forwarding rule under.
            network: |4-
                For internal load balancing, this field identifies the network that
                the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If
                this field is not specified, the default network will be used.
                This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
            network_tier: |4-
                The networking tier used for configuring this address. If this field is not
                specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
                Possible values are PREMIUM and STANDARD.
            port_range: |4-
                This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
                TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
                TargetPool, TargetInstance.
                Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
                addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
                Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
                disjoint port ranges.
                Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
                ports:
            ports: |4-
                This field is used along with internal load balancing and network
                load balancer when the forwarding rule references a backend service
                and when protocol is not L3_DEFAULT.
                A single port or a comma separated list of ports can be configured.
                Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the backends
                configured with this forwarding rule.
                You can only use one of ports and portRange, or allPorts.
                The three are mutually exclusive.
                You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports, which can be non-contiguous.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            region: |4-
                A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides.
                This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.
            self_link: The URI of the created resource.
            service: |4-
                Service Directory service to register the forwarding rule under.
            service_directory_registrations: |4-
                Service Directory resources to register this forwarding rule with. Currently,
                only supports a single Service Directory resource.
                Structure is documented below.
            service_label: |4-
                An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
                If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
                name.
                The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
                Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
                regular expression [a-z]? which means the first
                character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
                must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.
                This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
            service_name: |-
                The internal fully qualified service name for this Forwarding Rule.
                This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
            subnetwork: |4-
                The subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this
                Forwarding Rule.  This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
                If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is
                optional. However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a
                subnetwork must be specified.
            target: |4-
                The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic.
                The target must live in the same region as the forwarding rule.
                The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target
                object.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.

                The URL of the network in which to reserve the IP range. The IP range
                must be in RFC1918 space. The network cannot be deleted if there are
                any reserved IP ranges referring to it.
                This should only be set when using an Internal address.
            prefix_length: |4-
                The prefix length of the IP range. If not present, it means the
                address field is a single IP address.
                This field is not applicable to addresses with addressType=EXTERNAL,
                or addressType=INTERNAL when purpose=PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.

                An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
                you create the resource.
            filter_labels: |4-
                The list of label value pairs that must match labels in the
                provided metadata based on filterMatchCriteria
                This list must not be empty and can have at the most 64 entries.
                Structure is documented below.
            filter_match_criteria: |4-
                Specifies how individual filterLabel matches within the list of
                filterLabels contribute towards the overall metadataFilter match.
                MATCH_ANY - At least one of the filterLabels must have a matching
                label in the provided metadata.
                MATCH_ALL - All filterLabels must have matching labels in the
                provided metadata.
                Possible values are MATCH_ANY and MATCH_ALL.
            id: an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/global/forwardingRules/{{name}}
            ip_address: |4-
                The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
                traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
                the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
                loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
                type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
                to IP address specifications.
                An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
                reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
                reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
                The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
                that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
                For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
                Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
            ip_protocol: |4-
                The IP protocol to which this rule applies. When the load balancing scheme is
                INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, only TCP is valid. This field must not be set if the
                global address is configured as a purpose of PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT
                and addressType of INTERNAL
                Possible values are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, and ICMP.
            ip_version: |4-
                The IP Version that will be used by this global forwarding rule.
                Possible values are IPV4 and IPV6.
            label_fingerprint: |4-
                The fingerprint used for optimistic locking of this resource.  Used
                internally during updates.
            labels: |4-
                Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
            load_balancing_scheme: |4-
                This signifies what the GlobalForwardingRule will be used for.
                The value of INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED means that this will be used for
                Internal Global HTTP LB. The value of EXTERNAL means that this
                will be used for External Global Load Balancing (HTTP LB,
                External TCP/UDP LB, SSL Proxy). The value of EXTERNAL_MANAGED means
                that this will be used for Global external HTTP load balancers.
                 Note: This field must be set "" if the global address is
                configured as a purpose of PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT and addressType of INTERNAL.
                Default value is EXTERNAL.
                Possible values are EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, and INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
            metadata_filters: |4-
                Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing
                configuration to a limited set xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
                requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. If a
                match takes place, the relevant routing configuration is made available
                to those proxies.
                For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set
                to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the
                corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria
                is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with
                corresponding labels in the provided metadata.
                metadataFilters specified here can be overridden by those specified in
                the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references.
                metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their
                loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
                Structure is documented below.
            network: |4-
                This field is not used for external load balancing.
                For INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, this field
                identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to
                for this global forwarding rule. If this field is not specified,
                the default network will be used.
            port_range: |4-
                This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
                TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
                TargetPool, TargetInstance.
                Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
                addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
                Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
                disjoint port ranges.
                Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
                ports:
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            self_link: The URI of the created resource.
            target: |4-
                The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic.
                The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object.
                For INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, only HTTP and HTTPS targets
                are valid.
                 For global address with a purpose of PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT and
                addressType of INTERNAL, only "all-apis" and "vpc-sc" are valid.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.
            value: |4-
                The value that the label must match. The value has a maximum
                length of 1024 characters.

            interface: ' The disk interface to use for attaching this disk; either SCSI or NVME.'
            ip_cidr_range: |-
                The IP CIDR range represented by this alias IP range. This IP CIDR range
                must belong to the specified subnetwork and cannot contain IP addresses reserved by
                system or used by other network interfaces. This range may be a single IP address
                , a netmask  or a CIDR format string .
            ipv6_access_config: |4-
                 An array of IPv6 access configurations for this interface.
                Currently, only one IPv6 access config, DIRECT_IPV6, is supported. If there is no ipv6AccessConfig
                specified, then this instance will have no external IPv6 Internet access. Structure documented below.
            ipv6_access_type: |-
                One of EXTERNAL, INTERNAL to indicate whether the IP can be accessed from the Internet.
                This field is always inherited from its subnetwork.
            label_fingerprint: The unique fingerprint of the labels.
            labels: ' A map of key/value label pairs to assign to the instance.'
            machine_type: ' The machine type to create.'

            metadata_fingerprint: The unique fingerprint of the metadata.
            metadata_startup_script: |4-
                 An alternative to using the
                startup-script metadata key, except this one forces the instance to be recreated
                 if it is changed. This replaces the startup-script
                metadata key on the created instance and thus the two mechanisms are not
                allowed to be used simultaneously.  Users are free to use either mechanism - the
                only distinction is that this separate attribute will cause a recreate on
                modification.  On import, metadata_startup_script will not be set - if you
                choose to specify it you will see a diff immediately after import causing a
                destroy/recreate operation. If importing an instance and specifying this value
                is desired, you will need to modify your state file manually using
                terraform state commands.
            min_cpu_platform: |4-
                 Specifies a minimum CPU platform for the VM instance. Applicable values are the friendly names of CPU platforms, such as
                Intel Haswell or Intel Skylake. See the complete list here.
                Note: allow_stopping_for_update must be set to true or your instance must have a desired_status of TERMINATED in order to update this field.
            min_node_cpus: ' The minimum number of virtual CPUs this instance will consume when running on a sole-tenant node.'
            name: |4-
                 A unique name for the resource, required by GCE.
                Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
            nat_ip: |4-
                 The IP address that will be 1:1 mapped to the instance's
                network ip. If not given, one will be generated.
            network: |4-
                 The name or self_link of the network to attach this interface to.
                Either network or subnetwork must be provided. If network isn't provided it will
                be inferred from the subnetwork.
            network_interface: |4-
                 Networks to attach to the instance. This can
                be specified multiple times. Structure is documented below.

                The field is output only, an IPv6 address from a subnetwork associated with the instance will be allocated dynamically.
            network_interface.0.ipv6_access_config.0.external_ipv6_prefix_length: The prefix length of the external IPv6 range.
            network_interface.0.network_ip: The internal ip address of the instance, either manually or dynamically assigned.
            network_ip: |4-
                 The private IP address to assign to the instance. If
                empty, the address will be automatically assigned.

                s-features, and network_interface.0.nic-type must be GVNIC
                in order for this setting to take effect.
            nic_type: ' The type of vNIC to be used on this interface. Possible values: GVNIC, VIRTIO_NET.'
            node_affinities: |4-
                 Specifies node affinities or anti-affinities
                to determine which sole-tenant nodes your instances and managed instance
                groups will use as host systems. Read more on sole-tenant node creation
                here.
                Structure documented below.

                 Identities that will be granted the privilege in role.
                Each entry can have one of the following values:
            policy_data: |4-
                 The policy data generated by
                a google_iam_policy data source.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the project will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no project is provided in the parent identifier and no project is specified, the provider project is used.
            role: |4-
                 The role that should be applied. Only one
                google_compute_instance_iam_binding can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
                [projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}.
            title: ' A title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose.'
            zone: |4-
                 A reference to the zone where the machine resides. Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to. If not specified,
                the value will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no zone is provided in the parent identifier and no
                zone is specified, it is taken from the provider configuration.

            disk_name: |4-
                 Name of the disk. When not provided, this defaults
                to the name of the instance.
            disk_size_gb: |4-
                 The size of the image in gigabytes. If not
                specified, it will inherit the size of its base image. For SCRATCH disks,
                the size must be exactly 375GB.
            disk_type: |4-
                 The GCE disk type. Such as "pd-ssd", "local-ssd",
                "pd-balanced" or "pd-standard".
            email: |4-
                 The service account e-mail address. If not given, the
                default Google Compute Engine service account is used.

            guest_accelerator: ' List of the type and count of accelerator cards attached to the instance. Structure documented below.'
            id: an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/global/instanceTemplates/{{name}}
            instance_description: |4-
                 A brief description to use for instances
                created from this template.
            interface: |4-
                 Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk,
                which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. Persistent disks must always use SCSI
                and the request will fail if you attempt to attach a persistent disk in any other format
                than SCSI. Local SSDs can use either NVME or SCSI.
            ip_cidr_range: |-
                The IP CIDR range represented by this alias IP range. This IP CIDR range
                must belong to the specified subnetwork and cannot contain IP addresses reserved by
                system or used by other network interfaces. At the time of writing only a
                netmask  may be supplied, with a CIDR format resulting in an API
                error.
            ipv6_access_config: |4-
                 An array of IPv6 access configurations for this interface.
                Currently, only one IPv6 access config, DIRECT_IPV6, is supported. If there is no ipv6AccessConfig
                specified, then this instance will have no external IPv6 Internet access. Structure documented below.
            kms_key_self_link: ' The self link of the encryption key that is stored in Google Cloud KMS'
            machine_type: ' The machine type to create.'
            metadata: |4-
                 Metadata key/value pairs to make available from
                within instances created from this template.
            metadata_fingerprint: The unique fingerprint of the metadata.
            metadata_startup_script: |4-
                 An alternative to using the
                startup-script metadata key, mostly to match the compute_instance resource.
                This replaces the startup-script metadata key on the created instance and
                thus the two mechanisms are not allowed to be used simultaneously.
            min_cpu_platform: |4-
                 Specifies a minimum CPU platform. Applicable values are the friendly names of CPU platforms, such as
                Intel Haswell or Intel Skylake. See the complete list here.
            mode: |4-
                 The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE
                or READ_ONLY. If you are attaching or creating a boot disk, this must

                unencrypted traffic. VMs can send traffic to, or receive traffic
                from, this type of attachment.
                IPSEC indicates that the attachment carries only traffic encrypted by
                an IPsec device such as an HA VPN gateway. VMs cannot directly send
                traffic to, or receive traffic from, such an attachment. To use

                The addresses must be RFC 1918 IP address ranges. When creating HA
                VPN gateway over the interconnect attachment, if the attachment is
                configured to use an RFC 1918 IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP
                address will be allocated from the IP address range specified
                here.
                For example, if the HA VPN gateway's interface 0 is paired to this
                interconnect attachment, then an RFC 1918 IP address for the VPN
                gateway interface 0 will be allocated from the IP address specified
                for this interconnect attachment.

        argumentDocs:
            autoscaling_policy: |4-
                The configuration parameters for the autoscaling algorithm. You can
                define one or more of the policies for an autoscaler: cpuUtilization,
                customMetricUtilizations, and loadBalancingUtilization.
                If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based
                on cpuUtilization to 0.6 or 60%.
                Structure is documented below.
            cooldown_period: |4-
                The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it
                starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents
                the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
                initializing, during which the collected usage would not be
                reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.
                Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
                numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
                instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
                and time the startup process.
            cpu_utilization: |4-
                Defines the CPU utilization policy that allows the autoscaler to
                scale based on the average CPU utilization of a managed instance
                group.
                Structure is documented below.
            create: Default is 20 minutes.
            creation_timestamp: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
            delete: Default is 20 minutes.
            disabled: |4-
                A boolean value that specifies if a scaling schedule can influence autoscaler recommendations. If set to true, then a scaling schedule has no effect.
            duration_sec: |4-
                The duration of time intervals  for which this scaling schedule will be running. The minimum allowed value is 300.
            filter: |4-
                A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                is exporting per-instance or per-group data.
                You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                You can only use direct equality comparison operator  without
                any functions for each selector.
                You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                be identical.
                The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                labels.
                If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.
                If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.
                You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                . If multiple
                TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

            min_replicas: |4-
                The minimum number of replicas that the autoscaler can scale down
                to. This cannot be less than 0. If not provided, autoscaler will
                choose a default value depending on maximum number of instances
                allowed.
            min_required_replicas: |4-
                Minimum number of VM instances that autoscaler will recommend in time intervals starting according to schedule.
            mode: |4-
                Defines operating mode for this policy.

                Possible values are OFF, ONLY_UP, and ON.

            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            region: |4-
                URL of the region where the instance group resides.
            scale_down_control: |4-
                Defines scale down controls to reduce the risk of response latency
                and outages due to abrupt scale-in events
                Structure is documented below.
            scale_in_control: |4-
                Defines scale in controls to reduce the risk of response latency
                and outages due to abrupt scale-in events
                Structure is documented below.
            scaling_schedules: |4-
                Scaling schedules defined for an autoscaler. Multiple schedules can be set on an autoscaler and they can overlap.
                Structure is documented below.
            schedule: |4-
                The start timestamps of time intervals when this scaling schedule should provide a scaling signal. This field uses the extended cron format .
            self_link: The URI of the created resource.
            single_instance_assignment: |4-
                If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the
                total amount of work to be done or resource usage, set this value to
                an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
                The autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
                value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                to group resizing.
                For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages
                or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to
                your instances.
                A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
                instead.
            time_zone: |4-
                The time zone to be used when interpreting the schedule. The value of this field must be a time zone name from the tz database: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database.
            type: |4-
                Defines how target utilization value is expressed for a
                Stackdriver Monitoring metric.
                Possible values are GAUGE, DELTA_PER_SECOND, and DELTA_PER_MINUTE.

            connection_draining_timeout_sec: |4-
                Time for which instance will be drained .
            connection_persistence_on_unhealthy_backends: "\nSpecifies connection persistence when backends are unhealthy.\nIf set to DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL, the existing connections persist on\nunhealthy backends only for connection-oriented protocols \nand only if the Tracking Mode is PER_CONNECTION \nor the Session Affinity is configured for 5-tuple. They do not persist\nfor UDP.\nIf set to NEVER_PERSIST, after a backend becomes unhealthy, the existing\nconnections on the unhealthy backend are never persisted on the unhealthy\nbackend. They are always diverted to newly selected healthy backends\n.\nIf set to ALWAYS_PERSIST, existing connections always persist on\nunhealthy backends regardless of protocol and session affinity. It is\ngenerally not recommended to use this mode overriding the default.\nDefault value is DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL.\nPossible values are DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL, NEVER_PERSIST, and ALWAYS_PERSIST."
            connection_tracking_policy: |4-
                Connection Tracking configuration for this BackendService.
                This is available only for Layer 4 Internal Load Balancing and
                Network Load Balancing.

            consecutive_errors: |4-
                Number of errors before a host is ejected from the connection pool. When the
                backend host is accessed over HTTP, a 5xx return code qualifies as an error.
                Defaults to 5.
            consecutive_gateway_failure: |4-
                The number of consecutive gateway failures  before a consecutive
                gateway failure ejection occurs. Defaults to 5.
            consistent_hash: |4-
                Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session
                affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
                policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
                destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
                destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
                hashing.
                This field only applies when all of the following are true -
            create: Default is 20 minutes.
            creation_timestamp: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
            default_ttl: |4-

            disable_connection_drain_on_failover: |4-
                On failover or failback, this field indicates whether connection drain
                will be honored. Setting this to true has the following effect: connections
                to the old active pool are not drained. Connections to the new active pool
                use the timeout of 10 min . Setting to false has the
                following effect: both old and new connections will have a drain timeout
                of 10 min.
                This can be set to true only if the protocol is TCP.
                The default is false.
            drop_traffic_if_unhealthy: |4-
                This option is used only when no healthy VMs are detected in the primary
                and backup instance groups. When set to true, traffic is dropped. When
                set to false, new connections are sent across all VMs in the primary group.
                The default is false.
            enable: |4-
                Whether to enable logging for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service.

                The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
                status is detected through consecutive 5xx. This setting can be used to disable
                ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
            enforcing_consecutive_gateway_failure: |4-
                The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
                status is detected through consecutive gateway failures. This setting can be
                used to disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 0.
            enforcing_success_rate: |4-
                The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
                status is detected through success rate statistics. This setting can be used to
                disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
            failover: |4-
                This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More
                than one failover backend can be configured for a given RegionBackendService.
            failover_policy: |4-
                Policy for failovers.
                Structure is documented below.
            failover_ratio: |4-
                The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. If the ratio of the healthy
                VMs in the primary backend is at or below this number, traffic arriving
                at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the failover backend.
                In case where 'failoverRatio' is not set or all the VMs in the backup
                backend are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary
                backend in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy
                VMs with the best effort, or to all VMs when no VM is healthy.
                This field is only used with l4 load balancing.

                The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
                of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
                instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
                the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
                are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
                For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
                endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
                located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
                Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
                Network Endpoint Group backends.
                When the load_balancing_scheme is INTERNAL, only instance groups
                are supported.
                Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
                partial URL.
            health_checks: |4-

                or serverless NEG as a backend.
            http_cookie: |4-
                Hash is based on HTTP Cookie. This field describes a HTTP cookie
                that will be used as the hash key for the consistent hash load
                balancer. If the cookie is not present, it will be generated.
                This field is applicable if the sessionAffinity is set to HTTP_COOKIE.
                Structure is documented below.
            http_header_name: |4-
                The hash based on the value of the specified header field.

                For NLB the minimum is 60 seconds and the maximum is 16 hours.
            include_host: |4-
                If true requests to different hosts will be cached separately.
            include_protocol: |4-
                If true, http and https requests will be cached separately.
            include_query_string: |4-
                If true, include query string parameters in the cache key
                according to query_string_whitelist and
                query_string_blacklist. If neither is set, the entire query
                string will be included.
                If false, the query string will be excluded from the cache
                key entirely.
            interval: |4-

                success rate outliers. If the number of hosts is less than this setting, outlier
                detection via success rate statistics is not performed for any host in the
                cluster. Defaults to 5.
            success_rate_request_volume: |4-
                The minimum number of total requests that must be collected in one interval  to include this host in success rate
                based outlier detection. If the volume is lower than this setting, outlier
                detection via success rate statistics is not performed for that host. Defaults
                to 100.
            success_rate_stdev_factor: |4-
                This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier
                ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success
                rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean
                success rate: mean - . This factor is divided
                by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the
                runtime value should be 1900. Defaults to 1900.
            timeout_sec: |4-
                How many seconds to wait for the backend before considering it a
                failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is [1, 86400].
            tracking_mode: |4-
                Specifies the key used for connection tracking. There are two options:
                PER_CONNECTION: The Connection Tracking is performed as per the
                Connection Key  for the specific protocol.
                PER_SESSION: The Connection Tracking is performed as per the
                configured Session Affinity. It matches the configured Session Affinity.
                Default value is PER_CONNECTION.
                Possible values are PER_CONNECTION and PER_SESSION.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.

                sourceSnapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty
                persistent disk.
                If you specify this field along with sourceImage or sourceSnapshot,

                or the size of the snapshot.
            snapshot: |4-
                The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as
                a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the following are
                valid values:
            source_snapshot_encryption_key: |4-
                The customer-supplied encryption key of the source snapshot. Required
                if the source snapshot is protected by a customer-supplied encryption
                key.
                Structure is documented below.
            source_snapshot_id: |-
                The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value
                identifies the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent
                disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot
                that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
                snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was
                used.
            type: |4-
                URL of the disk type resource describing which disk type to use to

                Structure is documented below.
            filter_match_criteria: |4-
                Specifies how individual filterLabel matches within the list of filterLabels
                contribute towards the overall metadataFilter match. Supported values are:
            fingerprint: |-
                Fingerprint of this resource. This field is used internally during
                updates of this resource.
            full_path_match: |4-
                For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the request must exactly
                match the value specified in fullPathMatch after removing any query parameters
                and anchor that may be part of the original URL. FullPathMatch must be between 1
                and 1024 characters. Only one of prefixMatch, fullPathMatch or regexMatch must
                be specified.
            header_matches: |4-
                Specifies a list of header match criteria, all of which must match corresponding
                headers in the request.
                Structure is documented below.
            host: |4-
                Host portion of the URL.
            host_rule: |4-

                Structure is documented below.
            hosts: |4-
                The list of host patterns to match. They must be valid
                hostnames, except * will match any string of . In
                that case, * must be the first character and must be followed in
                the pattern by either - or ..
            id: an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/urlMaps/{{name}}
            ignore_case: |4-
                Specifies that prefixMatch and fullPathMatch matches are case sensitive.
                Defaults to false.
            invert_match: |4-
                If set to false, the headerMatch is considered a match if the match criteria
                above are met. If set to true, the headerMatch is considered a match if the
                match criteria above are NOT met. Defaults to false.
            map_id: The unique identifier for the resource.
            match_rules: |4-
                The rules for determining a match.
                Structure is documented below.
            metadata_filters: |4-
                Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing configuration to
                a limited set xDS compliant clients. In their xDS requests to Loadbalancer, xDS
                clients present node metadata. If a match takes place, the relevant routing
                configuration is made available to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in
                this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the
                filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its
                filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match
                with corresponding labels in the provided metadata. metadataFilters specified
                here can be overrides those specified in ForwardingRule that refers to this
                UrlMap. metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their
                loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
                Structure is documented below.
            path: |4-
                Path portion of the URL.
            path_rule: |4-
                The list of path rules. Use this list instead of routeRules when routing based
                on simple path matching is all that's required. The order by which path rules
                are specified does not matter. Matches are always done on the longest-path-first
                basis. For example: a pathRule with a path /a/b/c/* will match before /a/b/*
                irrespective of the order in which those paths appear in this list. Within a
                given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or routeRules must be set.
                Structure is documented below.
            paths: |4-
                The list of path patterns to match. Each must start with / and the only place a
                * is allowed is at the end following a /. The string fed to the path matcher
                does not include any text after the first ? or #, and those chars are not
                allowed here.
            priority: |4-
                For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                a rule decreases as its number increases . The first rule
                that matches the request is applied.
                You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
                2147483647 inclusive.
                Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                future without any impact on existing rules.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            query_parameter_matches: |4-
                Specifies a list of query parameter match criteria, all of which must match
                corresponding query parameters in the request.
                Structure is documented below.
            range_end: |4-
                The end of the range .
            range_match: |4-
                The header value must be an integer and its value must be in the range specified
                in rangeMatch. If the header does not contain an integer, number or is empty,
                the match fails. For example for a range [-5, 0]
            range_start: |4-
                The start of the range .
            region: |4-
                The Region in which the url map should reside.
                If it is not provided, the provider region is used.
            route_rules: |4-
                The list of ordered HTTP route rules. Use this list instead of pathRules when
                advanced route matching and routing actions are desired. The order of specifying
                routeRules matters: the first rule that matches will cause its specified routing
                action to take effect. Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or
                routeRules must be set. routeRules are not supported in UrlMaps intended for
                External load balancers.
                Structure is documented below.
            self_link: The URI of the created resource.
            suffix_match: |4-
                The value of the header must end with the contents of suffixMatch. Only one of
                exactMatch, prefixMatch, suffixMatch, regexMatch, presentMatch or rangeMatch
                must be set.
            test: |4-
                The list of expected URL mappings. Requests to update this UrlMap will
                succeed only if all of the test cases pass.
                Structure is documented below.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.
            value: |4-
                The value of the label must match the specified value. value can have a maximum
                length of 1024 characters.

                An optional description of this resource. Provide this property
                when you create the resource.
            dest_range: |4-
                The destination range of outgoing packets that this route applies to.
                Only IPv4 is supported.
            id: an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/global/routes/{{name}}
            name: |4-
                Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035.  Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and
                match the regular expression [a-z]? which means
                the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the
                last character, which cannot be a dash.
            network: |4-
                The network that this route applies to.
            next_hop_gateway: |4-
                URL to a gateway that should handle matching packets.
                Currently, you can only specify the internet gateway, using a full or
                partial valid URL:
            next_hop_ilb: |4-
                The IP address or URL to a forwarding rule of type
                loadBalancingScheme=INTERNAL that should handle matching
                packets.
                With the GA provider you can only specify the forwarding
                rule as a partial or full URL. For example, the following
                are all valid values:
            next_hop_instance: |4-
                URL to an instance that should handle matching packets.
                You can specify this as a full or partial URL. For example:
            next_hop_ip: |4-
                Network IP address of an instance that should handle matching packets.
            next_hop_network: URL to a Network that should handle matching packets.
            next_hop_vpn_tunnel: |4-
                URL to a VpnTunnel that should handle matching packets.
            priority: |4-
                The priority of this route. Priority is used to break ties in cases
                where there is more than one matching route of equal prefix length.
                In the case of two routes with equal prefix length, the one with the
                lowest-numbered priority value wins.
                Default value is 1000. Valid range is 0 through 65535.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            self_link: The URI of the created resource.
            tags: |4-
                A list of instance tags to which this route applies.

            min_transmit_interval: |4-
                The minimum interval, in milliseconds, between BFD control packets
                transmitted to the peer router. The actual value is negotiated
                between the two routers and is equal to the greater of this value
                and the corresponding receive interval of the other router. If set,

                Region where the router and BgpPeer reside.
                If it is not provided, the provider region is used.
            router: |4-
                The name of the Cloud Router in which this BgpPeer will be configured.
            session_initialization_mode: |4-
                The BFD session initialization mode for this BGP peer.
                If set to ACTIVE, the Cloud Router will initiate the BFD session
                for this BGP peer. If set to PASSIVE, the Cloud Router will wait
                for the peer router to initiate the BFD session for this BGP peer.
                If set to DISABLED, BFD is disabled for this BGP peer.
                Possible values are ACTIVE, DISABLED, and PASSIVE.

                following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
                except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
            network: |4-
                The network this subnet belongs to.
                Only networks that are in the distributed mode can have subnetworks.
            private_ip_google_access: |4-
                When enabled, VMs in this subnetwork without external IP addresses can
                access Google APIs and services by using Private Google Access.
            private_ipv6_google_access: |4-
                The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs in this subnet.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            purpose: |4-
                The purpose of the resource. A subnetwork with purpose set to
                INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER is a user-created subnetwork that is
                reserved for Internal HTTP Load Balancing.
                If set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER you must also set the role field.
            range_name: |4-
                The name associated with this subnetwork secondary range, used
                when adding an alias IP range to a VM instance. The name must
                be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. The name
                must be unique within the subnetwork.
            region: |4-
                The GCP region for this subnetwork.
            role: |4-
                The role of subnetwork. Currently, this field is only used when
                purpose = INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. The value can be set to ACTIVE
                or BACKUP. An ACTIVE subnetwork is one that is currently being used
                for Internal HTTP Load Balancing. A BACKUP subnetwork is one that
                is ready to be promoted to ACTIVE or is currently draining.
                Possible values are ACTIVE and BACKUP.
            secondary_ip_range: |4-
                An array of configurations for secondary IP ranges for VM instances
                contained in this subnetwork. The primary IP of such VM must belong
                to the primary ipCidrRange of the subnetwork. The alias IPs may belong
                to either primary or secondary ranges.
                Note: This field uses attr-as-block mode to avoid
                breaking users during the 0.12 upgrade. To explicitly send a list
                of zero objects you must use the following syntax:
                example=[]
                For more details about this behavior, see this section.
                Structure is documented below.
            self_link: The URI of the created resource.
            stack_type: |4-
                The stack type for this subnet to identify whether the IPv6 feature is enabled or not.
                If not specified IPV4_ONLY will be used.
                Possible values are IPV4_ONLY and IPV4_IPV6.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.

                and its referenced BackendServices to not allow unsupported features.
                A gRPC application must use "xds:///" scheme in the target URI
                of the service it is connecting to. If false, indicates that the
                BackendServices referenced by the urlMap will be accessed by gRPC
                applications via a sidecar proxy. In this case, a gRPC application

                Structure is documented below.
            filter_match_criteria: |4-
                Specifies how individual filterLabel matches within the list of filterLabels
                contribute towards the overall metadataFilter match. Supported values are:
            fingerprint: |-
                Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object. This
                field is used in optimistic locking.
            full_path_match: |4-
                For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the request must exactly
                match the value specified in fullPathMatch after removing any query parameters
                and anchor that may be part of the original URL. FullPathMatch must be between 1
                and 1024 characters. Only one of prefixMatch, fullPathMatch or regexMatch must
                be specified.
            header_matches: |4-
                Specifies a list of header match criteria, all of which must match corresponding
                headers in the request.
                Structure is documented below.
            host: |4-

                The list of HostRules to use against the URL.
                Structure is documented below.
            hosts: |4-
                The list of host patterns to match. They must be valid hostnames, except * will
                match any string of . In that case, * must be the first character
                and must be followed in the pattern by either - or ..

                Specifies that prefixMatch and fullPathMatch matches are case sensitive.
                Defaults to false.
            invert_match: |4-
                If set to false, the headerMatch is considered a match if the match criteria
                above are met. If set to true, the headerMatch is considered a match if the
                match criteria above are NOT met. Defaults to false.
            map_id: The unique identifier for the resource.
            match_rules: |4-
                The rules for determining a match.
                Structure is documented below.
            metadata_filters: |4-
                Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing configuration to
                a limited set xDS compliant clients. In their xDS requests to Loadbalancer, xDS
                clients present node metadata. If a match takes place, the relevant routing
                configuration is made available to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in
                this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the
                filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its
                filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match
                with corresponding labels in the provided metadata. metadataFilters specified
                here can be overrides those specified in ForwardingRule that refers to this

                loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
                Structure is documented below.
            path: |4-
                Path portion of the URL.
            path_rule: |4-
                The list of path rules. Use this list instead of routeRules when routing based
                on simple path matching is all that's required. The order by which path rules
                are specified does not matter. Matches are always done on the longest-path-first
                basis. For example: a pathRule with a path /a/b/c/* will match before /a/b/*
                irrespective of the order in which those paths appear in this list. Within a
                given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or routeRules must be set.
                Structure is documented below.
            paths: |4-
                The list of path patterns to match. Each must start with / and the only place a
                * is allowed is at the end following a /. The string fed to the path matcher
                does not include any text after the first ? or #, and those chars are not
                allowed here.
            priority: |4-
                For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                a rule decreases as its number increases . The first rule
                that matches the request is applied.
                You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
                2147483647 inclusive.
                Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                future without any impact on existing rules.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            query_parameter_matches: |4-
                Specifies a list of query parameter match criteria, all of which must match
                corresponding query parameters in the request.
                Structure is documented below.
            range_end: |4-
                The end of the range .
            range_match: |4-
                The header value must be an integer and its value must be in the range specified
                in rangeMatch. If the header does not contain an integer, number or is empty,
                the match fails. For example for a range [-5, 0]   - -3 will match.  - 0 will
                not match.  - 0.25 will not match.  - -3someString will not match.   Only one of
                exactMatch, prefixMatch, suffixMatch, regexMatch, presentMatch or rangeMatch
                must be set.
                Structure is documented below.
            range_start: |4-
                The start of the range .
            route_rules: |4-
                The list of ordered HTTP route rules. Use this list instead of pathRules when
                advanced route matching and routing actions are desired. The order of specifying
                routeRules matters: the first rule that matches will cause its specified routing
                action to take effect. Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or
                routeRules must be set. routeRules are not supported in UrlMaps intended for
                External load balancers.
                Structure is documented below.
            self_link: The URI of the created resource.
            suffix_match: |4-
                The value of the header must end with the contents of suffixMatch. Only one of
                exactMatch, prefixMatch, suffixMatch, regexMatch, presentMatch or rangeMatch
                must be set.
            test: |4-
                The list of expected URL mapping tests. Request to update this UrlMap will
                succeed only if all of the test cases pass. You can specify a maximum of 100
                tests per UrlMap.
                Structure is documented below.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.
            value: |4-
                The value of the label must match the specified value. value can have a maximum
                length of 1024 characters.

                grouping mechanism for the attached Occurrences . This
                grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs
                gate the ability for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given
                Note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached
                Attestation Occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same

            signatures: |4-
                One or more signatures over serializedPayload.
                Verifier implementations should consider this attestation
                message verified if at least one signature verifies
                serializedPayload. See Signature in common.proto for more

            master_auth: |4-
                 The authentication information for accessing the
                Kubernetes master. Some values in this block are only returned by the API if
                your service account has permission to get credentials for your GKE cluster. If
                you see an unexpected diff unsetting your client cert, ensure you have the
                container.clusters.getCredentials permission.
                Structure is documented below.
            master_auth.0.client_certificate: |-

                configuration options for master authorized networks. Omit the
                nested cidr_blocks attribute to disallow external access .
                Structure is documented below.
            master_global_access_config: |-
                Controls cluster master global
                access settings. If unset, Terraform will no longer manage this field and will
                not modify the previously-set value. Structure is documented below.
            master_ipv4_cidr_block: |-
                The IP range in CIDR notation to use for
                the hosted master network. This range will be used for assigning private IP
                addresses to the cluster master and the ILB VIP. This range must not overlap
                with any other ranges in use within the cluster's network, and it must be a /28
                subnet. See Private Cluster Limitations
                for more details. This field only applies to private clusters, when
                enable_private_nodes is true.
            master_version: |-
                The current version of the master in the cluster. This may
                be different than the min_master_version set in the config if the master
                has been updated by GKE.
            maximum: ' Maximum amount of the resource in the cluster.'
            metadata: |4-
                 The metadata key/value pairs assigned to instances in
                the cluster. From GKE 1.12 onwards, disable-legacy-endpoints is set to
                true by the API; if metadata is set but that default value is not
                included, Terraform will attempt to unset the value. To avoid this, set the
                value in your config.
            min_master_version: |4-
                 The minimum version of the master. GKE
                will auto-update the master to new versions, so this does not guarantee the
                current master version--use the read-only master_version field to obtain that.
                If unset, the cluster's version will be set by GKE to the version of the most recent
                official release .  Most users will find
                the google_container_engine_versions data source useful - it indicates which versions
                are available, and can be use to approximate fuzzy versions in a
                Terraform-compatible way. If you intend to specify versions manually,
                the docs
                describe the various acceptable formats for this field.
            minimum: ' Minimum amount of the resource in the cluster.'
            mode: |4-
                 How to expose the node metadata to the workload running on the node.

                should write metrics to.
                Automatically send metrics from pods in the cluster to the Google Cloud Monitoring API.
                VM metrics will be collected by Google Compute Engine regardless of this setting
                Available options include
                monitoring.googleapis.com, monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes, and none.

                 Whether we should enable the network policy addon
                for the master.  This must be enabled in order to enable network policy for the nodes.
                To enable this, you must also define a network_policy block,
                otherwise nothing will happen.
                It can only be disabled if the nodes already do not have network policies enabled.
                Defaults to disabled; set disabled = false to enable.
            networking_mode: |4-
                 Determines whether alias IPs or routes will be used for pod IPs in the cluster.
                Options are VPC_NATIVE or ROUTES. VPC_NATIVE enables IP aliasing,
                and requires the ip_allocation_policy block to be defined. By default, when this field is unspecified and no ip_allocation_policy blocks are set, GKE will create a ROUTES-based cluster.
            node_config: |4-
                  Parameters used in creating the default node pool.
                Generally, this field should not be used at the same time as a
                google_container_node_pool or a node_pool block; this configuration
                manages the default node pool, which isn't recommended to be used with
                Terraform. Structure is documented below.
            node_group: ' Setting this field will assign instances of this pool to run on the specified node group. This is useful for running workloads on sole tenant nodes.'
            node_locations: |4-
                 The list of zones in which the cluster's nodes
                are located. Nodes must be in the region of their regional cluster or in the
                same region as their cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If this is specified for
                a zonal cluster, omit the cluster's zone.
            node_pool: |4-
                 List of node pools associated with this cluster.
                See google_container_node_pool for schema.
                Warning: node pools defined inside a cluster can't be changed  after
                cluster creation without deleting and recreating the entire cluster. Unless you absolutely need the ability
                to say "these are the only node pools associated with this cluster", use the
                google_container_node_pool resource instead of this property.
            node_version: |4-
                 The Kubernetes version on the nodes. Must either be unset
                or set to the same value as min_master_version on create. Defaults to the default
                version set by GKE which is not necessarily the latest version. This only affects
                nodes in the default node pool. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
                recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
                when fuzzy versions are used. See the google_container_engine_versions data source's
                version_prefix field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.
                To update nodes in other node pools, use the version attribute on the node pool.
            notification_config: ' Configuration for the cluster upgrade notifications feature. Structure is documented below.'

                feature, which provide more control over automatic upgrades of your GKE clusters.
                When updating this field, GKE imposes specific version requirements. See
                Selecting a new release channel
                for more details; the google_container_engine_versions datasource can provide
                the default version for a channel. Note that removing the release_channel
                field from your config will cause Terraform to stop managing your cluster's
                release channel, but will not unenroll it. Instead, use the "UNSPECIFIED"
                channel. Structure is documented below.
            remove_default_node_pool: |4-
                 If true, deletes the default node
                pool upon cluster creation. If you're using google_container_node_pool
                resources with no default node pool, this should be set to true, alongside
                setting initial_node_count to at least 1.
            resource_labels: ' The GCE resource labels  to be applied to the cluster.'
            resource_limits: |4-
                 Global constraints for machine resources in the
                cluster. Configuring the cpu and memory types is required if node
                auto-provisioning is enabled. These limits will apply to node pool autoscaling
                in addition to node auto-provisioning. Structure is documented below.
            resource_type: |4-
                 The type of the resource. For example, cpu and

                 A boolean
                that represents whether the underlying node VMs are spot. See the official documentation
                for more information. Defaults to false.

            subnetwork: |4-
                 The name or self_link of the Google Compute Engine
                subnetwork in which the cluster's instances are launched.
            sysctls: |4-
                  The Linux kernel parameters to be applied to the nodes
                and all pods running on the nodes. Specified as a map from the key, such as
                net.core.wmem_max, to a string value.
            tags: |4-
                 The list of instance tags applied to all nodes. Tags are used to identify
                valid sources or targets for network firewalls.
            taint: |4-
                 A list of Kubernetes taints
                to apply to nodes. GKE's API can only set this field on cluster creation.
                However, GKE will add taints to your nodes if you enable certain features such
                as GPUs. If this field is set, any diffs on this field will cause Terraform to
                recreate the underlying resource. Taint values can be updated safely in
                Kubernetes , and it's recommended that you do not use
                this field to manage taints. If you do, lifecycle.ignore_changes is
                recommended. Structure is documented below.

            value: ' Value for taint.'
            vertical_pod_autoscaling: |4-
                Vertical Pod Autoscaling automatically adjusts the resources of pods controlled by it.
                Structure is documented below.
            workload_identity_config: |4-
                Workload Identity allows Kubernetes service accounts to act as a user-managed
                Google IAM Service Account.
                Structure is documented below.
            workload_metadata_config: |4-

                 Configuration required by cluster autoscaler to adjust
                the size of the node pool to the current cluster usage. Structure is documented below.
            cluster: ' The cluster to create the node pool for. Cluster must be present in location provided for clusters. May be specified in the format projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/clusters/{{cluster}} or as just the name of the cluster.'

            id: an identifier for the resource with format {{project}}/{{location}}/{{cluster}}/{{name}}
            initial_node_count: |4-
                 The initial number of nodes for the pool. In
                regional or multi-zonal clusters, this is the number of nodes per zone. Changing
                this will force recreation of the resource. WARNING: Resizing your node pool manually
                may change this value in your existing cluster, which will trigger destruction
                and recreation on the next Terraform run .  If you don't
                need this value, don't set it.  If you do need it, you can use a lifecycle block to
                ignore subsequent changes to this field.
            instance_group_urls: The resource URLs of the managed instance groups associated with this node pool.

            managed_instance_group_urls: List of instance group URLs which have been assigned to this node pool.
            management: |4-
                 Node management configuration, wherein auto-repair and
                auto-upgrade is configured. Structure is documented below.
            max_node_count: ' Maximum number of nodes in the NodePool. Must be >= min_node_count.'
            max_pods_per_node: |4-
                 The maximum number of pods per node in this node pool.
                Note that this does not work on node pools which are "route-based" - that is, node
                pools belonging to clusters that do not have IP Aliasing enabled.
                See the official documentation
                for more information.
            max_surge: |4-
                 The number of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool during
                an upgrade. Increasing max_surge raises the number of nodes that can be upgraded simultaneously.
                Can be set to 0 or greater.
            max_unavailable: |4-
                 The number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable during
                an upgrade. Increasing max_unavailable raises the number of nodes that can be upgraded in
                parallel. Can be set to 0 or greater.
            min_node_count: |4-
                 Minimum number of nodes in the NodePool. Must be >=0 and
                <= max_node_count.
            name: |4-
                 The name of the node pool. If left blank, Terraform will
                auto-generate a unique name.
            name_prefix: |4-
                 Creates a unique name for the node pool beginning
                with the specified prefix. Conflicts with name.
            network_config: |4-
                 The network configuration of the pool. See
                google_container_cluster for schema.
            node_config: |4-
                 Parameters used in creating the node pool. See
                google_container_cluster for schema.
            node_count: |4-
                 The number of nodes per instance group. This field can be used to
                update the number of nodes per instance group but should not be used alongside autoscaling.
            node_locations: |4-
                The list of zones in which the node pool's nodes should be located. Nodes must
                be in the region of their regional cluster or in the same region as their
                cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If unspecified, the cluster-level
                node_locations will be used.
            placement_policy: |4-
                 Specifies a custom placement policy for the
                nodes.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which to create the node pool. If blank,
                the provider-configured project will be used.
            type: |4-
                 The type of the policy. Supports a single value: COMPACT.
                Specifying COMPACT placement policy type places node pool's nodes in a closer
                physical proximity in order to reduce network latency between nodes.
            update: ' Used for updates to node pools'
            upgrade_settings: |4-
                 Specify node upgrade settings to change how many nodes GKE attempts to
                upgrade at once. The number of nodes upgraded simultaneously is the sum of max_surge and max_unavailable.
                The maximum number of nodes upgraded simultaneously is limited to 20. Structure is documented below.
            version: |4-
                 The Kubernetes version for the nodes in this pool. Note that if this field
                and auto_upgrade are both specified, they will fight each other for what the node version should
                be, so setting both is highly discouraged. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
                recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
                when fuzzy versions are used. See the google_container_engine_versions data source's
                version_prefix field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.

                Resources like Entry can have schemas associated with them. This scope allows users to attach tags to an
                individual column based on that schema.
                For attaching a tag to a nested column, use . to separate the column names. Example:
                outer_column.inner_column
            create: Default is 20 minutes.
            delete: Default is 20 minutes.

            enum_value: |4-
                Holds the value for a tag field with enum type. This value must be one of the allowed values in the definition of this enum.
                Structure is documented below.
            field_name: ' The identifier for this object. Format specified above.'
            fields: |4-
                This maps the ID of a tag field to the value of and additional information about that field.
                Valid field IDs are defined by the tag's template. A tag must have at least 1 field and at most 500 fields.
                Structure is documented below.
            id: an identifier for the resource with format {{name}}
            name: |-
                The resource name of the tag in URL format. Example:

                projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/entrygroups/{entryGroupId}/tags/{tag_id}
                where tag_id is a system-generated identifier. Note that this Tag may not actually be stored in the location in this name.
            order: |-
                The order of this field with respect to other fields in this tag. For example, a higher value can indicate
                a more important field. The value can be negative. Multiple fields can have the same order, and field orders
                within a tag do not have to be sequential.
            parent: |4-
                The name of the parent this tag is attached to. This can be the name of an entry or an entry group. If an entry group, the tag will be attached to
                all entries in that group.
            string_value: |4-
                Holds the value for a tag field with string type.
            template: |4-
                The resource name of the tag template that this tag uses. Example:
                projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/tagTemplates/{tagTemplateId}
                This field cannot be modified after creation.
            template_displayname: The display name of the tag template.
            timestamp_value: |4-
                Holds the value for a tag field with timestamp type.

            create: Default is 20 minutes.
            crypto_deterministic_config: |4-
                Pseudonymization method that generates deterministic encryption for the given input. Outputs a base64 encoded representation of the encrypted output. Uses AES-SIV based on the RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5297.
                Structure is documented below.
            crypto_replace_ffx_fpe_config: |4-
                Replaces an identifier with a surrogate using Format Preserving Encryption  with the FFX mode of operation; however when used in the content.reidentify API method, it serves the opposite function by reversing the surrogate back into the original identifier. The identifier must be encoded as ASCII. For a given crypto key and context, the same identifier will be replaced with the same surrogate. Identifiers must be at least two characters long. In the case that the identifier is the empty string, it will be skipped. See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/pseudonymization to learn more.
                Note: We recommend using CryptoDeterministicConfig for all use cases which do not require preserving the input alphabet space and size, plus warrant referential integrity.

            limits: |4-
                Configuration to control the number of findings returned.
                Structure is documented below.
            matching_type: |4-
                How the rule is applied. See the documentation for more information: https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#MatchingType
                Possible values are MATCHING_TYPE_FULL_MATCH, MATCHING_TYPE_PARTIAL_MATCH, and MATCHING_TYPE_INVERSE_MATCH.
            max_findings: |4-
                Max findings limit for the given infoType.
            max_findings_per_info_type: |4-
                Configuration of findings limit given for specified infoTypes.
                Structure is documented below.
            max_findings_per_item: |4-

                Default value is POSSIBLE.
                Possible values are VERY_UNLIKELY, UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, and VERY_LIKELY.
            parent: |4-
                The parent of the inspect template in any of the following formats:
            proximity: |4-
                Proximity of the finding within which the entire hotword must reside. The total length of the window cannot
                exceed 1000 characters. Note that the finding itself will be included in the window, so that hotwords may be
                used to match substrings of the finding itself. For example, the certainty of a phone number regex
                 \d{3}-\d{4} could be adjusted upwards if the area code is known to be the local area code of a company
                office using the hotword regex , where xxx is the area code in question.
                Structure is documented below.
            relative_likelihood: |4-
                Increase or decrease the likelihood by the specified number of levels. For example,
                if a finding would be POSSIBLE without the detection rule and relativeLikelihood is 1,
                then it is upgraded to LIKELY, while a value of -1 would downgrade it to UNLIKELY.
                Likelihood may never drop below VERY_UNLIKELY or exceed VERY_LIKELY, so applying an
                adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is VERY_LIKELY
                will result in a final likelihood of LIKELY. Either this or fixed_likelihood can be set.
            rule_set: |4-
                Set of rules to apply to the findings for this InspectConfig. Exclusion rules, contained in the set are executed in the end,
                other rules are executed in the order they are specified for each info type.
                Structure is documented below.
            rules: |4-
                Set of rules to be applied to infoTypes. The rules are applied in order.
                Structure is documented below.
            stored_type: |4-
                A reference to a StoredInfoType to use with scanning.
                Structure is documented below.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.
            window_after: |4-
                Number of characters after the finding to consider. Either this or window_before must be specified
            window_before: |4-
                Number of characters before the finding to consider. Either this or window_after must be specified

                Fraction of average pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to
                remove workers. A scale-down factor of 1 will result in scaling down so that there
                is no available memory remaining after the update .
                A scale-down factor of 0 disables removing workers, which can be beneficial for

                Minimum scale-down threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs.
                For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must
                recommend at least a 2 worker scale-down for the cluster to scale. A threshold of 0
                means the autoscaler will scale down on any recommended change.
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0]. Default: 0.0.
            scale_up_factor: |4-
                Fraction of average pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to
                add workers. A scale-up factor of 1.0 will result in scaling up so that there
                is no pending memory remaining after the update .
                A scale-up factor closer to 0 will result in a smaller magnitude of scaling up
                .
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0].
            scale_up_min_worker_fraction: |4-
                Minimum scale-up threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling
                occurs. For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler
                must recommend at least a 2-worker scale-up for the cluster to scale. A threshold of
                0 means the autoscaler will scale up on any recommended change.

            classification_threshold: |4-
                To filter out false positive results and still get variety in matched natural language inputs for your agent, you can tune the machine learning classification threshold.
                If the returned score value is less than the threshold value, then a no-match event will be triggered. The score values range from 0.0  to 1.0 . If set to 0.0, the default of 0.3 is used.
            condition: |4-
                The condition to evaluate against form parameters or session parameters.
                At least one of intent or condition must be specified. When both intent and condition are specified, the transition can only happen when both are fulfilled.

            event_handlers: |4-
                A flow's event handlers serve two purposes:
                They are responsible for handling events  in the flow.
                They are inherited by every page's [event handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
                Unlike transitionRoutes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.
                Structure is documented below.

            transition_routes: |4-
                A flow's transition routes serve two purposes:
                They are responsible for matching the user's first utterances in the flow.
                They are inherited by every page's [transition routes][Page.transition_routes] and can support use cases such as the user saying "help" or "can I talk to a human?", which can be handled in a common way regardless of the current page. Transition routes defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.

            display_name: |4-
                The human-readable name of the intent, unique within the agent.
            entity_type: |4-
                The entity type of the parameter.
                Format: projects/-/locations/-/agents/-/entityTypes/ for system entity types , or projects//locations//agents//entityTypes/ for developer entity types.
            is_fallback: |4-
                Indicates whether this is a fallback intent. Currently only default fallback intent is allowed in the agent, which is added upon agent creation.
                Adding training phrases to fallback intent is useful in the case of requests that are mistakenly matched, since training phrases assigned to fallback intents act as negative examples that triggers no-match event.
            is_list: |4-
                Indicates whether the parameter represents a list of values.
            labels: |4-
                The key/value metadata to label an intent. Labels can contain lowercase letters, digits and the symbols '-' and '_'. International characters are allowed, including letters from unicase alphabets. Keys must start with a letter. Keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters and no more than 128 bytes.
                Prefix "sys-" is reserved for Dialogflow defined labels. Currently allowed Dialogflow defined labels include: * sys-head * sys-contextual The above labels do not require value. "sys-head" means the intent is a head intent. "sys.contextual" means the intent is a contextual intent.
                An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.
            language_code: |4-

                The parameter used to annotate this part of the training phrase. This field is required for annotated parts of the training phrase.
            parameters: |4-
                The collection of parameters associated with the intent.
                Structure is documented below.
            parent: |4-
                The agent to create an intent for.
                Format: projects//locations//agents/.
            parts: |4-
                The ordered list of training phrase parts. The parts are concatenated in order to form the training phrase.
                Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does.
                Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated.
                If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set.
                If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways:
                Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters.
                Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the parameterId field is set.
                Structure is documented below.
            priority: |4-
                The priority of this intent. Higher numbers represent higher priorities.
                If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the Normal priority in the console.
                If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests.
            redact: |4-
                Indicates whether the parameter content should be redacted in log. If redaction is enabled, the parameter content will be replaced by parameter name during logging.
                Note: the parameter content is subject to redaction if either parameter level redaction or entity type level redaction is enabled.
            repeat_count: |4-
                Indicates how many times this example was added to the intent.
            text: |4-
                The text for this part.
            training_phrases: |4-
                The collection of training phrases the agent is trained on to identify the intent.

            networks: |4-
                The list of VPC networks that can see this zone. Until the provider updates to use the Terraform 0.12 SDK in a future release, you
                may experience issues with this resource while updating. If you've defined a networks block and
                add another networks block while keeping the old block, Terraform will see an incorrect diff
                and apply an incorrect update to the resource. If you encounter this issue, remove all networks
                blocks in an update and then apply another update adding all of them back simultaneously.

                are named after the resource types, e.g. "Patient", "Observation". When there is no existing table for a given
                resource type, the server attempts to create one.
                See the streaming config reference for more details.

            disable_referential_integrity: |4-
                Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store
                creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API will enforce referential integrity and fail the
                requests that will result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API
                will skip referential integrity check. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as
                Patient.get$everything, will not return all the results if broken references exist.
                ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store  **
            disable_resource_versioning: |4-
                Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation
                of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations will cause historical
                versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but
                cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions will be kept. The server will send back errors for
                attempts to read the historical versions.
                ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store  **
            enable_history_import: |4-
                Whether to allow the bulk import API to accept history bundles and directly insert historical resource
                versions into the FHIR store. Importing resource histories creates resource interactions that appear to have
                occurred in the past, which clients may not want to allow. If set to false, history bundles within an import
                will fail with an error.
                ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store  **
                ** This property can be changed manually in the Google Cloud Healthcare admin console without recreating the FHIR store **
            enable_update_create: |4-
                Whether this FHIR store has the updateCreate capability. This determines if the client can use an Update
                operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through
                the Create operation and attempts to Update a non-existent resource will return errors. Please treat the audit
                logs with appropriate levels of care if client-specified resource IDs contain sensitive data such as patient
                identifiers, those IDs will be part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Cloud Pub/Sub
                notifications.

                No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.
                An object containing a list of "key": value pairs.
                Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.
            name: |4-
                The resource name for the FhirStore.
                ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store  **
            notification_config: |4-
                A nested object resource
                Structure is documented below.
            pubsub_topic: |4-
                The Cloud Pub/Sub topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client.
                PubsubMessage.Data will contain the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message.
                It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message
                was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. Topic names must be scoped to a
                project. service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-healthcare.iam.gserviceaccount.com must have publisher permissions on the given
                Cloud Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions will cause the calls that send notifications to fail.
            recursive_structure_depth: |4-
                The depth for all recursive structures in the output analytics schema. For example, concept in the CodeSystem
                resource is a recursive structure; when the depth is 2, the CodeSystem table will have a column called
                concept.concept but not concept.concept.concept. If not specified or set to 0, the server will use the default
                value 2. The maximum depth allowed is 5.
            resource_types: |4-
                Supply a FHIR resource type . See
                https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-resource-types.html for a list of all FHIR resource types. The server treats
                an empty list as an intent to stream all the supported resource types in this FHIR store.
            schema_config: |4-
                The configuration for the exported BigQuery schema.
                Structure is documented below.
            schema_type: |4-
                Specifies the output schema type.
            self_link: The fully qualified name of this dataset
            stream_configs: |4-
                A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in
                this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next
                resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed
                from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required
                bigquery.dataEditor role to your project's Cloud Healthcare Service Agent service account. Some lag  is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
                Structure is documented below.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.
            version: |4-
                The FHIR specification version.
                Default value is STU3.
                Possible values are DSTU2, STU3, and R4.

                User defined CEVAL expression. A CEVAL expression is used to specify match criteria such as origin.ip, source.region_code and contents in the request header.
                Structure is documented below.
            denied_permissions: |4-
                The permissions that are explicitly denied by this rule. Each permission uses the format {service-fqdn}/{resource}.{verb},
                where {service-fqdn} is the fully qualified domain name for the service. For example, iam.googleapis.com/roles.list.
            denied_principals: |4-
                The identities that are prevented from using one or more permissions on Google Cloud resources.
            deny_rule: |4-
                A deny rule in an IAM deny policy.
                Structure is documented below.
            display_name: |4-
                The display name of the rule.
            etag: The hash of the resource. Used internally during updates.
            exception_permissions: |4-
                Specifies the permissions that this rule excludes from the set of denied permissions given by deniedPermissions.
                If a permission appears in deniedPermissions and in exceptionPermissions then it will not be denied.
                The excluded permissions can be specified using the same syntax as deniedPermissions.
            exception_principals: |4-
                The identities that are excluded from the deny rule, even if they are listed in the deniedPrincipals.
                For example, you could add a Google group to the deniedPrincipals, then exclude specific users who belong to that group.
            expression: |4-
                Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.
            id: an identifier for the resource with format {{parent}}/{{name}}
            location: |4-
                String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting,
                e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
            name: |4-
                The name of the policy.
            parent: |4-
                The attachment point is identified by its URL-encoded full resource name.
            rules: |4-
                Rules to be applied.
                Structure is documented below.
            title: |4-
                Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose.
                This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.

                Each value must be a Common Expression Language
                function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified
                by the corresponding map key.
                You can use the assertion keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of
                the authentication credential issued by the provider.
                The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated,
                the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB.
                For AWS providers, the following rules apply:
            attribute_condition: |4-
                A Common Expression Language expression, in
                plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication credentials issued by the
                provider should not be accepted.
                The expression must output a boolean representing whether to allow the federation.
                The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions:
            attribute_mapping: |4-
                Maps attributes from authentication credentials issued by an external identity provider
                to Google Cloud attributes, such as subject and segment.
                Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to.
                The following keys are supported:
            aws: |4-

            bounds: |4-
                The values must be monotonically increasing.
            bucket_options: |4-
                The bucketOptions are required when the logs-based metric is using a DISTRIBUTION value type and it
                describes the bucket boundaries used to create a histogram of the extracted values.
                Structure is documented below.

            delete: Default is 20 minutes.
            display_name: |4-
                A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces. Use sentence case
                without an ending period, for example "Request count". This field is optional but it is
                recommended to be set for any metrics associated with user-visible concepts, such as Quota.
            explicit_buckets: |4-
                Specifies a set of buckets with arbitrary widths.
                Structure is documented below.
            exponential_buckets: |4-
                Specifies an exponential sequence of buckets that have a width that is proportional to the value of
                the lower bound. Each bucket represents a constant relative uncertainty on a specific value in the bucket.
                Structure is documented below.
            filter: |4-
                An advanced logs filter  which

                The label key.
            label_extractors: |4-
                A map from a label key string to an extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log
                entry field and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the LabelDescriptor must
                have an associated extractor expression in this map. The syntax of the extractor expression is
                the same as for the valueExtractor field.
            labels: |4-
                The set of labels that can be used to describe a specific instance of this metric type. For
                example, the appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies metric type has a label
                for the HTTP response code, response_code, so you can look at latencies for successful responses
                or just for responses that failed.
                Structure is documented below.
            linear_buckets: |4-
                Specifies a linear sequence of buckets that all have the same width .
                Each bucket represents a constant absolute uncertainty on the specific value in the bucket.
                Structure is documented below.
            metric_descriptor: |4-
                The metric descriptor associated with the logs-based metric.
                Structure is documented below.
            metric_kind: |4-
                Whether the metric records instantaneous values, changes to a value, etc.
                Some combinations of metricKind and valueType might not be supported.
                For counter metrics, set this to DELTA.
                Possible values are DELTA, GAUGE, and CUMULATIVE.
            name: |4-
                The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples - "error_count", "nginx/requests".
                Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following
                characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the special characters _-.,+!*',()%/. The forward-slash
                character  denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character
                of the name.
            offset: |4-
                Lower bound of the first bucket.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.

                Must be greater than 0.
            unit: |4-
                The unit in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the valueType is
                INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The supported units are a subset of
                The Unified Code for Units of Measure standard
            update: Default is 20 minutes.
            value_extractor: |4-
                A valueExtractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to
                record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction - EXTRACT or
                REGEXP_EXTRACT. The argument are 1. field - The name of the log entry field from which
                the value is to be extracted. 2. regex - A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax
                 with a single capture group to extract data from the specified
                log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an
                error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.
            width: |4-
                Must be greater than 0.

            documentation: |4-
                Documentation that is included with notifications and incidents related
                to this policy. Best practice is for the documentation to include information
                to help responders understand, mitigate, escalate, and correct the underlying
                problems detected by the alerting policy. Notification channels that have
                limited capacity might not show this documentation.
                Structure is documented below.
            enabled: |4-
                Whether or not the policy is enabled. The default is true.
            id: an identifier for the resource with format {{name}}
            label_extractors: |4-
                A map from a label key to an extractor expression, which is used to
                extract the value for this label key. Each entry in this map is
                a specification for how data should be extracted from log entries that
                match filter. Each combination of extracted values is treated as
                a separate rule for the purposes of triggering notifications.
                Label keys and corresponding values can be used in notifications
                generated by this condition.
            mime_type: |4-
                The format of the content field. Presently, only the value
                "text/markdown" is supported.
            mutate_time: When the change occurred.
            mutated_by: The email address of the user making the change.
            notification_channels: |4-
                Identifies the notification channels to which notifications should be
                sent when incidents are opened or closed or when new violations occur
                on an already opened incident. Each element of this array corresponds
                to the name field in each of the NotificationChannel objects that are
                returned from the notificationChannels.list method. The syntax of the
                entries in this field is
                projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]
            notification_rate_limit: |4-
                Required for alert policies with a LogMatch condition.
                This limit is not implemented for alert policies that are not log-based.
                Structure is documented below.
            period: |4-
                Not more than one notification per period.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            query: |4-
                Monitoring Query Language query that outputs a boolean stream.
            threshold_value: |4-
                A value against which to compare the time
                series.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.
            user_labels: |4-
                This field is intended to be used for organizing and identifying the AlertPolicy
                objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited
                to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values
                can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys
                must begin with a letter.

            monitored_resource_types: If present, then a time series, which is identified partially by a metric type and a MonitoredResourceDescriptor, that is associated with this metric type can only be associated with one of the monitored resource types listed here. This field allows time series to be associated with the intersection of this metric type and the monitored resource types in this list.
            name: The resource name of the metric descriptor.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            sample_period: |4-
                The sampling period of metric data points. For metrics which are written periodically, consecutive data points are stored at this time interval, excluding data loss due to errors. Metrics with a higher granularity have a smaller sampling period. In [duration format].
            type: |4-
                The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not URL-encoded. All service defined metrics must be prefixed with the service name, in the format of {service name}/{relative metric name}, such as cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/cpu/utilization. The relative metric name must have only upper and lower-case letters, digits, '/' and underscores '_' are allowed. Additionally, the maximum number of characters allowed for the relative_metric_name is 100. All user-defined metric types have the DNS name custom.googleapis.com, external.googleapis.com, or logging.googleapis.com/user/.
            unit: |4-
                The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the
                valueType is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of
                the stored metric values.
                Different systems may scale the values to be more easily displayed . However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is always in
                thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed.
                If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job,
                you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} . If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as
                12005.
                Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you
                can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value
                12.005 , or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 .
                The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure standard.
                More info can be found in the API documentation
                .

            display_name: |4-
                An optional human-readable name for this notification channel. It is recommended that you specify a non-empty and unique name in order to make it easier to identify the channels in your project, though this is not enforced. The display name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.
            enabled: |4-
                Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel. This makes it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular channel without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference the channel. This is a more convenient approach when the change is temporary and you want to receive notifications from the same set of alerting policies on the channel at some point in the future.
            id: an identifier for the resource with format {{name}}
            labels: |4-
                Configuration fields that define the channel and its behavior. The
                permissible and required labels are specified in the
                NotificationChannelDescriptor corresponding to the type field.
                Labels with sensitive data are obfuscated by the API and therefore Terraform cannot
                determine if there are upstream changes to these fields. They can also be configured via
                the sensitive_labels block, but cannot be configured in both places.
            name: |-
                The full REST resource name for this channel. The syntax is:
                projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]
                The [CHANNEL_ID] is automatically assigned by the server on creation.
            password: |4-
                An password for a notification channel. Channel types that support this field include: webhook_basicauth
                Note: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            sensitive_labels: |4-
                Different notification type behaviors are configured primarily using the the labels field on this
                resource. This block contains the labels which contain secrets or passwords so that they can be marked
                sensitive and hidden from plan output. The name of the field, eg: password, will be the key
                in the labels map in the api request.
                Credentials may not be specified in both locations and will cause an error. Changing from one location
                to a different credential configuration in the config will require an apply to update state.
                Structure is documented below.
            service_key: |4-
                An servicekey token for a notification channel. Channel types that support this field include: pagerduty
                Note: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.
            type: |4-
                The type of the notification channel. This field matches the value of the NotificationChannelDescriptor.type field. See https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list to get the list of valid values such as "email", "slack", etc...
            update: Default is 20 minutes.
            user_labels: |4-
                User-supplied key/value data that does not need to conform to the corresponding NotificationChannelDescriptor's schema, unlike the labels field. This field is intended to be used for organizing and identifying the NotificationChannel objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.
            verification_status: Indicates whether this channel has been verified or not. On a ListNotificationChannels or GetNotificationChannel operation, this field is expected to be populated.If the value is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning ; otherwise, it is assumed that the channel works.If the channel is neither VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it implies that the channel is of a type that does not require verification or that this specific channel has been exempted from verification because it was created prior to verification being required for channels of this type.This field cannot be modified using a standard UpdateNotificationChannel operation. To change the value of this field, you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.

            destination: |4-
                Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.
                You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
                Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
                destination location.
                Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
                location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
                endpoint from route information.
                If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
                multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
                destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
                interface.
                A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
                is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
                don't intend to test.
                Structure is documented below.

                Other projects that may be relevant for reachability analysis.
                This is applicable to scenarios where a test can cross project
                boundaries.
            source: |4-
                Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.
                You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
                 instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
                source location.
                Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
                a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud  network, then you must
                also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
                which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
                information.
                If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
                you must provide the destination VPC network.
                If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
                network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
                identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
                address or VPC network.
                A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
                ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
                you don't intend to test.

                The value of timeout.maxAttemptsTimeout dictates the timeout across all origins.
                A reference to a Topic resource.
            id: an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/locations/global/edgeCacheOrigins/{{name}}

                Set of label tags associated with the EdgeCache resource.
            max_attempts: |4-
                The maximum number of attempts to cache fill from this origin. Another attempt is made when a cache fill fails with one of the retryConditions.
                Once maxAttempts to this origin have failed the failoverOrigin will be used, if one is specified. That failoverOrigin may specify its own maxAttempts,
                retryConditions and failoverOrigin to control its own cache fill failures.
                The total number of allowed attempts to cache fill across this and failover origins is limited to four.
                The total time allowed for cache fill attempts across this and failover origins can be controlled with maxAttemptsTimeout.
                The last valid, non-retried response from all origins will be returned to the client.
                If no origin returns a valid response, an HTTP 502 will be returned to the client.
                Defaults to 1. Must be a value greater than 0 and less than 4.
            max_attempts_timeout: |4-
                The maximum time across all connection attempts to the origin, including failover origins, before returning an error to the client. A HTTP 504 will be returned if the timeout is reached before a response is returned.
                Defaults to 15 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s.
                If a failoverOrigin is specified, the maxAttemptsTimeout of the first configured origin sets the deadline for all connection attempts across all failoverOrigins.
            name: |4-
                Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
                The name must be 1-64 characters long, and match the regular expression [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]* which means the first character must be a letter,
                and all following characters must be a dash, underscore, letter or digit.
            origin_address: |4-
                A fully qualified domain name  or IP address reachable over the public Internet, or the address of a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
                This address will be used as the origin for cache requests - e.g. FQDN: media-backend.example.com, IPv4: 35.218.1.1, IPv6: 2607:f8b0:4012:809::200e, Cloud Storage: gs://bucketname
                When providing an FQDN , it must be publicly resolvable  and IP addresses must be publicly routable.  It must not contain a protocol  and it must not contain any slashes.
                If a Cloud Storage bucket is provided, it must be in the canonical "gs://bucketname" format. Other forms, such as "storage.googleapis.com", will be rejected.
            port: |4-
                The port to connect to the origin on.
                Defaults to port 443 for HTTP2 and HTTPS protocols, and port 80 for HTTP.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            protocol: |4-
                The protocol to use to connect to the configured origin. Defaults to HTTP2, and it is strongly recommended that users use HTTP2 for both security & performance.
                When using HTTP2 or HTTPS as the protocol, a valid, publicly-signed, unexpired TLS  certificate must be presented by the origin server.
                Possible values are HTTP2, HTTPS, and HTTP.
            read_timeout: |4-
                The maximum duration to wait between reads of a single HTTP connection/stream.
                Defaults to 15 seconds.  The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s.
                The readTimeout is capped by the responseTimeout.  All reads of the HTTP connection/stream must be completed by the deadline set by the responseTimeout.
                If the response headers have already been written to the connection, the response will be truncated and logged.
            response_timeout: |4-
                The maximum duration to wait for the last byte of a response to arrive when reading from the HTTP connection/stream.
                Defaults to 30 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 120s.
                The responseTimeout starts after the connection has been established.
                This also applies to HTTP Chunked Transfer Encoding responses, and/or when an open-ended Range request is made to the origin. Origins that take longer to write additional bytes to the response than the configured responseTimeout will result in an error being returned to the client.
                If the response headers have already been written to the connection, the response will be truncated and logged.
            retry_conditions: |4-
                Specifies one or more retry conditions for the configured origin.
                If the failure mode during a connection attempt to the origin matches the configured retryCondition,
                the origin request will be retried up to maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if configured, will then be used to satisfy the request.
                The default retryCondition is "CONNECT_FAILURE".
                retryConditions apply to this origin, and not subsequent failoverOrigin,
                which may specify their own retryConditions and maxAttempts.
                Valid values are:
            timeout: |4-
                The connection and HTTP timeout configuration for this origin.
                Structure is documented below.

            allow_credentials: |4-
                In response to a preflight request, setting this to true indicates that the actual request can include user credentials.
                This translates to the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials response header.
            allow_headers: |4-

                Structure is documented below.
            cache_mode: |4-
                Cache modes allow users to control the behaviour of the cache, what content it should cache automatically, whether to respect origin headers, or whether to unconditionally cache all responses.
                For all cache modes, Cache-Control headers will be passed to the client. Use clientTtl to override what is sent to the client.
                Possible values are CACHE_ALL_STATIC, USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, FORCE_CACHE_ALL, and BYPASS_CACHE.
            cdn_policy: |4-
                The policy to use for defining caching and signed request behaviour for requests that match this route.

                Disables HTTP/2.
                HTTP/2  is enabled by default and recommended for performance. HTTP/2 improves connection re-use and reduces connection setup overhead by sending multiple streams over the same connection.
                Some legacy HTTP clients may have issues with HTTP/2 connections due to broken HTTP/2 implementations. Setting this to true will prevent HTTP/2 from being advertised and negotiated.
            disable_quic: |4-

                Specifies whether to enable logging for traffic served by this service.
            exclude_host: |4-
                If true, requests to different hosts will be cached separately.
                Note: this should only be enabled if hosts share the same origin and content. Removing the host from the cache key may inadvertently result in different objects being cached than intended, depending on which route the first user matched.
            exclude_query_string: |4-
                If true, exclude query string parameters from the cache key
                If false , include the query string parameters in
                the cache key according to includeQueryParameters and
                excludeQueryParameters. If neither includeQueryParameters nor
                excludeQueryParameters is set, the entire query string will be
                included.

                The list of host patterns to match.
                Host patterns must be valid hostnames. Ports are not allowed. Wildcard hosts are supported in the suffix or prefix form. * matches any string of . It does not match the empty string.
                When multiple hosts are specified, hosts are matched in the following priority:
            https_redirect: |4-
                If set to true, the URL scheme in the redirected request is set to https. If set to false, the URL scheme of the redirected request will remain the same as that of the request.
                This can only be set if there is at least one  edgeSslCertificate set on the service.

                Either specify includedQueryParameters or excludedQueryParameters, not both. '&' and '=' will be percent encoded and not treated as delimiters.
            invert_match: |4-
                If set to false , the headerMatch is considered a match if the match criteria above are met.
                If set to true, the headerMatch is considered a match if the match criteria above are NOT met.
            ipv4_addresses: The IPv4 addresses associated with this service. Addresses are static for the lifetime of the service.
            ipv6_addresses: The IPv6 addresses associated with this service. Addresses are static for the lifetime of the service.

                Structure is documented below.
            max_age: |4-
                Specifies how long results of a preflight request can be cached by a client in seconds. Note that many browser clients enforce a maximum TTL of 600s .
            max_ttl: |4-
                Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin.
                Defaults to 86400s .
                Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTtl seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive.
            negative_caching: |4-
                Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency.
                By default, the CDNPolicy will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:
            negative_caching_policy: |4-

                pathRedirect cannot be supplied together with prefixRedirect. Supply one alone or neither. If neither is supplied, the path of the original request will be used for the redirect.
                The path value must be between 1 and 1024 characters.
            path_template_match: |4-
                For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the request
                must match the wildcard pattern specified in pathTemplateMatch
                after removing any query parameters and anchor that may be part
                of the original URL.
                pathTemplateMatch must be between 1 and 255 characters
                .  The pattern specified by pathTemplateMatch may

            path_template_rewrite: |4-
                Prior to forwarding the request to the selected origin, if the
                request matched a pathTemplateMatch, the matching portion of the
                request's path is replaced re-written using the pattern specified
                by pathTemplateRewrite.
                pathTemplateRewrite must be between 1 and 255 characters
                , must start with a '/', and must only use variables
                captured by the route's pathTemplate matchers.
                pathTemplateRewrite may only be used when all of a route's
                MatchRules specify pathTemplate.
                Only one of pathPrefixRewrite and pathTemplateRewrite may be
                specified.
            prefix_redirect: |4-
                The prefix that replaces the prefixMatch specified in the routeRule, retaining the remaining portion of the URL before redirecting the request.
                prefixRedirect cannot be supplied together with pathRedirect. Supply one alone or neither. If neither is supplied, the path of the original request will be used for the redirect.
            priority: |4-
                The priority of this route rule, where 1 is the highest priority.
                You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 1 and 999 inclusive.
                Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers
                to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.

            condition: |4-
                A condition which determines whether this rule is used in the evaluation of the policy. When set, the expression field in the `Expr' must include from 1 to 10 subexpressions, joined by the "||" or "&&" operators. Each subexpression must be of the form "resource.matchTag". or "resource.matchTagId". where key_name and value_name are the resource names for Label Keys and Values. These names are available from the Tag Manager Service. An example expression is: "resource.matchTag". or "resource.matchTagId".

                If true, then the Policy is enforced. If false, then any configuration is acceptable. This field can be set only in Policies for boolean constraints.
            etag: An opaque tag indicating the current version of the Policy, used for concurrency control. This field is ignored if used in a CreatePolicy request. When the Policy is returned from either a GetPolicy or a ListPolicies request, this etag indicates the version of the current Policy to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the Policy is returned from a GetEffectivePolicy request, the etag will be unset.

                Determines the inheritance behavior for this Policy. If inherit_from_parent is true, PolicyRules set higher up in the hierarchy  are inherited and present in the effective policy. If it is false, then no rules are inherited, and this Policy becomes the new root for evaluation. This field can be set only for Policies which configure list constraints.

                Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
            name: |4-
                Immutable. The resource name of the Policy. Must be one of the following forms, where constraint_name is the name of the constraint which this Policy configures: * projects/{project_number}/policies/{constraint_name} * folders/{folder_id}/policies/{constraint_name} * organizations/{organization_id}/policies/{constraint_name} For example, "projects/123/policies/compute.disableSerialPortAccess". Note: projects/{project_id}/policies/{constraint_name} is also an acceptable name for API requests, but responses will return the name using the equivalent project number.
            parent: |4-
                The parent of the resource.
            reset: |4-
                Ignores policies set above this resource and restores the constraint_default enforcement behavior of the specific Constraint at this resource. This field can be set in policies for either list or boolean constraints. If set, rules must be empty and inherit_from_parent must be set to false.
            rules: |4-
                Up to 10 PolicyRules are allowed. In Policies for boolean constraints, the following requirements apply: - There must be one and only one PolicyRule where condition is unset. - BooleanPolicyRules with conditions must set enforced to the opposite of the PolicyRule without a condition. - During policy evaluation, PolicyRules with conditions that are true for a target resource take precedence.
            spec: |4-
                Basic information about the Organization Policy.
            title: |4-
                Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.
            update: Default is 20 minutes.
            update_time: Output only. The time stamp this was previously updated. This represents the last time a call to CreatePolicy or UpdatePolicy was made for that Policy.
            values: |4-
                List of values to be used for this PolicyRule. This field can be set only in Policies for list constraints.

        argumentDocs:
            allow_insecure: |4-
                Defaults to false. When false, recipes are subject to validations based on the artifact type:
                Remote: A checksum must be specified, and only protocols with transport-layer security are permitted.
                GCS: An object generation number must be specified.
            apt: |4-
                An Apt Repository.
                Structure is documented below.
            archive_type: |4-
                Type of archive files in this repository. The default behavior is DEB.
                Default value is DEB.
                Possible values are DEB and DEB_SRC.
            artifacts: |4-
                Resources available to be used in the steps in the recipe.

            assignment: |4-
                Specifies the VM instances that are assigned to this policy. This allows you to target sets
                or groups of VM instances by different parameters such as labels, names, OS, or zones.
                If left empty, all VM instances underneath this policy are targeted.
                At the same level in the resource hierarchy , the service prevents
                the creation of multiple policies that conflict with each other.
                For more information, see how the service
                handles assignment conflicts.
                Structure is documented below.

                Must be provided if allowInsecure is false. Generation number of the Google Cloud Storage object.
                https://storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket/foo/bar#1234567 this value would be 1234567.
            goo: |4-
                A Goo Repository.
                Structure is documented below.

                Structure is documented below.
            instance_name_prefixes: |4-
                Targets VM instances whose name starts with one of these prefixes.
                Like labels, this is another way to group VM instances when targeting configs,
                for example prefix="prod-".
                Only supported for project-level policies.
            instances: |4-
                Targets any of the instances specified. Instances are specified by their URI in the form
                zones/[ZONE]/instances/[INSTANCE_NAME].
                Instance targeting is uncommon and is supported to facilitate the management of changes
                by the instance or to target specific VM instances for development and testing.
                Only supported for project-level policies and must reference instances within this project.
            labels: |4-
                Google Compute Engine instance labels that must be present for an instance to be included in this assignment group.
            manager: |4-
                Type of package manager that can be used to install this package. If a system does not have the package manager,
                the package is not installed or removed no error message is returned. By default, or if you specify ANY,
                the agent attempts to install and remove this package using the default package manager.
                This is useful when creating a policy that applies to different types of systems.
                The default behavior is ANY.
                Default value is ANY.
                Possible values are ANY, APT, YUM, ZYPPER, and GOO.
            object: |4-
                Name of the Google Cloud Storage object. Given an example URL: https://storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket/foo/bar#1234567
                this value would be foo/bar.
            os_architecture: |4-

                Description of the patch deployment. Length of the description is limited to 1024 characters.
            disruption_budget: |4-
                The maximum number  of VMs per zone to disrupt at any given moment. The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up.
                During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps.
                A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget.
                For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone.
                For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of 10, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops.

            ack_deadline_seconds: |4-
                This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
                before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
                delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
                acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
                again during that time .
                For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
                the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
                subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
                pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
                maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds .
                If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.
                For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
                for the call to the push endpoint.
                If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
                will eventually redeliver the message.
            attributes: |4-
                Endpoint configuration attributes.
                Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
                be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.
                The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
                can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
                attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
                the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
                . The endpoint version is
                based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.
                If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
                it will default to the version of the API used to make
                such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
                call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
                calls will always return a valid version, even if the
                subscription was created without this attribute.
                The possible values for this attribute are:
            audience: "\nAudience to be used when generating OIDC token. The audience claim\nidentifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. The audience\nvalue is a single case-sensitive string. Having multiple values \nfor the audience field is not supported. More info about the OIDC JWT\ntoken audience here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3\nNote: if not specified, the Push endpoint URL will be used."
            create: Default is 20 minutes.
            dead_letter_policy: |4-
                A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in
                this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering
                is disabled.
                The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscription's
                parent project  must have
                permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.
                Structure is documented below.
            dead_letter_topic: |4-
                The name of the topic to which dead letter messages should be published.
                Format is projects/{project}/topics/{topic}.
                The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with the enclosing subscription's
                parent project  must have
                permission to Publish() to this topic.
                The operation will fail if the topic does not exist.
                Users should ensure that there is a subscription attached to this topic
                since messages published to a topic with no subscriptions are lost.
            delete: Default is 20 minutes.
            enable_message_ordering: |4-
                If true, messages published with the same orderingKey in PubsubMessage will be delivered to
                the subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they
                may be delivered in any order.
            expiration_policy: |4-
                A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration.
                A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber
                is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing
                operations on the subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default
                policy with ttl of 31 days will be used.  If it is set but ttl is "", the
                resource never expires.  The minimum allowed value for expirationPolicy.ttl
                is 1 day.
                Structure is documented below.
            filter: |4-
                The subscription only delivers the messages that match the filter.
                Pub/Sub automatically acknowledges the messages that don't match the filter. You can filter messages
                by their attributes. The maximum length of a filter is 256 bytes. After creating the subscription,
                you can't modify the filter.
            id: an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/subscriptions/{{name}}
            labels: |4-
                A set of key/value label pairs to assign to this Subscription.
            max_delivery_attempts: |4-
                The maximum number of delivery attempts for any message. The value must be
                between 5 and 100.
                The number of delivery attempts is defined as 1 + .
                A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. Note that
                client libraries may automatically extend ack_deadlines.
                This field will be honored on a best effort basis.
                If this parameter is 0, a default value of 5 is used.
            maximum_backoff: |4-
                The maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 600 seconds.
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: "3.5s".
            message_retention_duration: |4-
                How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
                backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
                retain_acked_messages is true, then this also configures the retention
                of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a
                subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more
                than 7 days  or less than 10 minutes .
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated
                by 's'. Example: "600.5s".
            minimum_backoff: |4-
                The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: "3.5s".
            name: |4-
                Name of the subscription.
            oidc_token: |4-
                If specified, Pub/Sub will generate and attach an OIDC JWT token as
                an Authorization header in the HTTP request for every pushed message.
                Structure is documented below.
            project: |4-
                 The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            push_config: |4-
                If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to
                configure it. An empty pushConfig signifies that the subscriber will
                pull and ack messages using API methods.
                Structure is documented below.
            push_endpoint: |4-
                A URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed.
                For example, a Webhook endpoint might use
                "https://example.com/push".
            retain_acked_messages: |4-
                Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then
                messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if
                they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
                messageRetentionDuration window.
            retry_policy: |4-
                A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription.
                If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers.
                RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message
                Structure is documented below.
            service_account_email: |4-
                Service account email to be used for generating the OIDC token.
                The caller  must have the
                iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission for the service account.
            topic: |4-
                A reference to a Topic resource.
            ttl: |4-
                Specifies the "time-to-live" duration for an associated resource. The
                resource expires if it is not active for a period of ttl.
                If ttl is not set, the associated resource never expires.
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'.
                Example - "3.5s".
            update: Default is 20 minutes.
