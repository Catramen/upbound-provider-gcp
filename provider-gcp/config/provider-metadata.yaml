                portion must be properly truncated (i.e. all the host bits must
                be zero) or the input is considered malformed. For example,
                "192.0.2.0/24" is accepted but "192.0.2.1/24" is not. Similarly,

            perimeter_type: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
                bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
                and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
                ONE regular Service Perimeter.
                In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.
                Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                themselves.
                Default value is PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR.
                Possible values are PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR and PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE.
            permission: |-
                -

                corresponding serviceName in ApiOperation.
            resource: |-
                -

                A Google Cloud resource that is allowed to ingress the perimeter.
                Requests from these resources will be allowed to access perimeter data.
                Currently only projects are allowed. Format projects/{project_number}
                The project may be in any Google Cloud organization, not just the
                organization that the perimeter is defined in. * is not allowed, the case
                of allowing all Google Cloud resources only is not supported.
            resources: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of resources, currently only projects in the form
                projects/<projectnumber>, that match this to stanza. A request matches
                if it contains a resource in this list. If * is specified for resources,
                then this EgressTo rule will authorize access to all resources outside

                -
                (Optional)
                GCP services that are subject to the Service Perimeter
                restrictions. Must contain a list of services. For example, if
                storage.googleapis.com is specified, access to the storage
                buckets inside the perimeter must meet the perimeter's access
                restrictions.
            service_name: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The name of the API whose methods or permissions the IngressPolicy or
                EgressPolicy want to allow. A single ApiOperation with serviceName
                field set to * will allow all methods AND permissions for all services.
            sources: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Sources that this IngressPolicy authorizes access from.

            spec: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Proposed (or dry run) ServicePerimeter configuration.
                This configuration allows to specify and test ServicePerimeter configuration
                without enforcing actual access restrictions. Only allowed to be set when
                the useExplicitDryRunSpec flag is set.
                Structure is documented below.
            status: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                ServicePerimeter configuration. Specifies sets of resources,
                restricted services and access levels that determine
                perimeter content and boundaries.
                Structure is documented below.

            update_time: |-
                -
                Time the AccessPolicy was updated in UTC.
            use_explicit_dry_run_spec: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists
                for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
                Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
                bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.

                Perimeter.

                In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.
                Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                themselves.
                Default value is PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR.
                Possible values are PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR and PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE.
            permission: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Value for permission should be a valid Cloud IAM permission for the
                corresponding serviceName in ApiOperation.
            resource: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A Google Cloud resource that is allowed to ingress the perimeter.
                Requests from these resources will be allowed to access perimeter data.
                Currently only projects are allowed. Format projects/{project_number}
                The project may be in any Google Cloud organization, not just the
                organization that the perimeter is defined in. * is not allowed, the case
                of allowing all Google Cloud resources only is not supported.
            resources: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of resources, currently only projects in the form
                projects/<projectnumber>, that match this to stanza. A request matches
                if it contains a resource in this list. If * is specified for resources,
                then this EgressTo rule will authorize access to all resources outside
                the perimeter.
            restricted_services: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                GCP services that are subject to the Service Perimeter
                restrictions. Must contain a list of services. For example, if
                storage.googleapis.com is specified, access to the storage
                buckets inside the perimeter must meet the perimeter's access
                restrictions.
            service_name: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The name of the API whose methods or permissions the IngressPolicy or
                EgressPolicy want to allow. A single ApiOperation with serviceName
                field set to * will allow all methods AND permissions for all services.

            spec: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Proposed (or dry run) ServicePerimeter configuration.
                This configuration allows to specify and test ServicePerimeter configuration
                without enforcing actual access restrictions. Only allowed to be set when
                the useExplicitDryRunSpec flag is set.
                Structure is documented below.
            status: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                ServicePerimeter configuration. Specifies sets of resources,
                restricted services and access levels that determine
                perimeter content and boundaries.
                Structure is documented below.

            use_explicit_dry_run_spec: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists
                for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
                Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
                bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.
            vpc_accessible_services: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                Perimeter.

                (Optional)
                ID of the AuthorizedCertificate resource configuring SSL for the application. Clearing this field will
                remove SSL support.
                By default, a managed certificate is automatically created for every domain mapping. To omit SSL support
                or to configure SSL manually, specify SslManagementType.MANUAL on a CREATE or UPDATE request. You must be
                authorized to administer the AuthorizedCertificate resource to manually map it to a DomainMapping resource.
                Example: 12345.
            create: '- Default is 20 minutes.'
            delete: '- Default is 20 minutes.'

            name: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Relative name of the object affected by this record. Only applicable for CNAME records. Example: 'www'.
            override_strategy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Whether the domain creation should override any existing mappings for this domain.
                By default, overrides are rejected.
                Default value is STRICT.
                Possible values are STRICT and OVERRIDE.
            pending_managed_certificate_id: |-
                -
                ID of the managed AuthorizedCertificate resource currently being provisioned, if applicable. Until the new
                managed certificate has been successfully provisioned, the previous SSL state will be preserved. Once the
                provisioning process completes, the certificateId field will reflect the new managed certificate and this
                field will be left empty. To remove SSL support while there is still a pending managed certificate, clear the
                certificateId field with an update request.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            resource_records: |-
                -
                The resource records required to configure this domain mapping. These records must be added to the domain's DNS
                configuration in order to serve the application via this domain mapping.
                Structure is documented below.
            rrdata: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Data for this record. Values vary by record type, as defined in RFC 1035 (section 5) and RFC 1034 (section 3.6.1).

                -
                (Required)
                SSL management type for this domain. If AUTOMATIC, a managed certificate is automatically provisioned.
                If MANUAL, certificateId must be manually specified in order to configure SSL for this domain.
                Possible values are AUTOMATIC and MANUAL.
            ssl_settings: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                SSL configuration for this domain. If unconfigured, this domain will not serve with SSL.

                By default, the rollout strategy for Endpoints is "FIXED". This means that Endpoints starts up with a particular configuration ID.
                When a new configuration is rolled out, Endpoints must be given the new configuration ID. The configId field is used to give the configuration ID
                and is required in this case.
                Endpoints also has a rollout strategy called "MANAGED". When using this, Endpoints fetches the latest configuration and does not need
                the configuration ID. In this case, configId must be omitted.

                affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will
                have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.
                Setting this property overrides the use of defaultTableExpirationMs
                for partitioned tables: only one of defaultTableExpirationMs and
                defaultPartitionExpirationMs will be used for any new partitioned
                table. If you provide an explicit timePartitioning.expirationMs when
                creating or updating a partitioned table, that value takes precedence
                over the default partition expiration time indicated by this property.

                property set to the creation time plus

                new tables, not existing ones. When the expirationTime for a given
                table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically.
                If a table's expirationTime is modified or removed before the
                table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when
                creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default
                expiration time indicated by this property.

                post-create. See
                official docs.
            special_group: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A special group to grant access to. Possible values include:
            table_id: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The ID of the table. The ID must contain only letters (a-z,
                A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum length
                is 1,024 characters.
            target_types: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Which resources in the dataset this entry applies to. Currently, only views are supported,
                but additional target types may be added in the future. Possible values: VIEWS
            user_by_email: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                An email address of a user to grant access to. For example:
                fred@example.com
            view: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A view from a different dataset to grant access to. Queries
                executed against that view will have read access to tables in
                this dataset. The role field is not required when this field is
                set. If that view is updated by any user, access to the view
                needs to be granted again via an update operation.
                Structure is documented below.

            allow_jagged_rows: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. The missing values are treated as nulls.
                If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records,
                an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. Only applicable to CSV, ignored for other formats.
            allow_large_results: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, allows the query to produce arbitrarily large result tables at a slight cost in performance.
                Requires destinationTable to be set. For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and large results are always allowed.
                However, you must still set destinationTable when result size exceeds the allowed maximum response size.
            allow_quoted_newlines: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported:
                CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table.
                CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a 'notFound' error is returned in the job result.
                Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion
                Default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED.
                Possible values are CREATE_IF_NEEDED and CREATE_NEVER.

            errors: |-
                -
                The first errors encountered during the running of the job. The final message
                includes the number of errors that caused the process to stop. Errors here do
                not necessarily mean that the job has not completed or was unsuccessful.
                Structure is documented below.
            expiration_ms: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Number of milliseconds for which to keep the storage for a partition. A wrapper is used here because 0 is an invalid value.
            extract: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Configures an extract job.
                Structure is documented below.
            field: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If not set, the table is partitioned by pseudo column '_PARTITIONTIME'; if set, the table is partitioned by this field.
                The field must be a top-level TIMESTAMP or DATE field. Its mode must be NULLABLE or REQUIRED.
                A wrapper is used here because an empty string is an invalid value.

                -
                (Optional)
                When extracting data in CSV format, this defines the delimiter to use between fields in the exported data.
                Default is ','
            flatten_results: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, flattens all nested and repeated fields in the query results.
                allowLargeResults must be true if this is set to false. For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and results are never flattened.
            id: '- an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/jobs/{{job_id}}'
            ignore_unknown_values: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema.
                If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records,
                and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
                The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value:
                CSV: Trailing columns
                JSON: Named values that don't match any column names
            inline_code: |-

                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value,
                an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.
            maximum_billing_tier: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Limits the billing tier for this job. Queries that have resource usage beyond this tier will fail (without incurring a charge).

            maximum_bytes_billed: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Limits the bytes billed for this job. Queries that will have bytes billed beyond this limit will fail (without incurring a charge).
                If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.

                (Optional)
                Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify "\N", BigQuery interprets "\N" as a null value
                when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an
                empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as
                an empty value.

            quote: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding,
                and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.
                The default value is a double-quote ('"'). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string.
                If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.
            reason: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A short error code that summarizes the error.
            resource_uri: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A code resource to load from a Google Cloud Storage URI (gs://bucket/path).
            schema_update_options: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Allows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the load job if a schema is autodetected or
                supplied in the job configuration. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND;
                when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators.
                For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified:
                ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema.
                ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.
            script_options: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Options controlling the execution of scripts.
                Structure is documented below.
            skip_leading_rows: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data.
                The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.
                When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following:
                skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected,
                the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row.
                skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row.
                skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected,
                row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

                WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data and uses the schema from the query result.
                WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table.
                WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result.
                Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully.
                Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
                Default value is WRITE_EMPTY.
                Possible values are WRITE_TRUNCATE, WRITE_APPEND, and WRITE_EMPTY.

                encrypt this table.  Note that the default bigquery service account will need to have
                encrypt/decrypt permissions on this key - you may want to see the

            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
                is not provided, the provider project is used.

            quote: |-
                (Required) - The value that is used to quote data sections in a
                CSV file. If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the
                property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline
                characters, you must also set the allow_quoted_newlines property to true.
                The API-side default is ", specified in Terraform escaped as \". Due to
                limitations with Terraform default values, this value is required to be
                explicitly set.
            range: |-
                - (Required) Information required to partition based on ranges.

                - (Optional) If set to true, queries over this table
                require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be
                specified.
            schema: |-
                - (Optional) A JSON schema for the external table. Schema is required
                for CSV and JSON formats if autodetect is not on. Schema is disallowed
                for Google Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Datastore backups, Avro, ORC and Parquet formats.
                ~>NOTE: Because this field expects a JSON string, any changes to the
                string will create a diff, even if the JSON itself hasn't changed.
                Furthermore drift for this field cannot not be detected because BigQuery
                only uses this schema to compute the effective schema for the table, therefore
                any changes on the configured value will force the table to be recreated.
                This schema is effectively only applied when creating a table from an external
                datasource, after creation the computed schema will be stored in
                google_bigquery_table.schema

            skip_leading_rows: |-
                (Optional) - The number of rows at the top of the sheet
                that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. At least one of range or
                skip_leading_rows must be set.
            source_format: |-
                (Required) - The data format. Supported values are:
                "CSV", "GOOGLE_SHEETS", "NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON", "AVRO", "PARQUET", "ORC",
                "DATSTORE_BACKUP", and "BIGTABLE". To use "GOOGLE_SHEETS"
                the scopes must include
                "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly".
            source_uri_prefix: |-
                (Optional) - When hive partition detection is requested,

                before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following
                this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro
                gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive
                partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix
                can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/.
                Note that when mode is set to CUSTOM, you must encode the partition key schema within the source_uri_prefix by setting source_uri_prefix to gs://bucket/path_to_table/{key1:TYPE1}/{key2:TYPE2}/{key3:TYPE3}.

                is not provided, the provider project is used.
            storage_type: |-
                - (Optional) The storage type to use. One of "SSD" or
                "HDD". Defaults to "SSD".

                this Attestor will use as the principal when querying Container
                Analysis. Attestor administrators must grant this service account
                the IAM role needed to read attestations from the noteReference in
                Container Analysis (containeranalysis.notes.occurrences.viewer).
                This email address is fixed for the lifetime of the Attestor, but
                callers should not make any other assumptions about the service

                -
                (Required)
                The resource name of a ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Note, created by the
                user. If the Note is in a different project from the Attestor, it
                should be specified in the format projects/*/notes/* (or the legacy
                providers/*/notes/*). This field may not be updated.
                An attestation by this attestor is stored as a Container Analysis
                ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Occurrence that names a container image
                and that links to this Note.

                NOTE: id may be explicitly provided by the caller when using this
                type of public key, but it MUST be a valid RFC3986 URI. If id is left
                blank, a default one will be computed based on the digest of the DER
                encoding of the public key.
                Structure is documented below.

                Public keys that verify attestations signed by this attestor. This
                field may be updated.
                If this field is non-empty, one of the specified public keys must
                verify that an attestation was signed by this attestor for the
                image specified in the admission request.
                If this field is empty, this attestor always returns that no valid
                attestations exist.
                Structure is documented below.
            signature_algorithm: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The signature algorithm used to verify a message against
                a signature using this key. These signature algorithm must
                match the structure and any object identifiers encoded in
                publicKeyPem (i.e. this algorithm must match that of the
                public key).

                Annotations is a key value map stored with a resource that
                may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. More
                info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
                Note: The Cloud Run API may add additional annotations that were not provided in your config.
                If terraform plan shows a diff where a server-side annotation is added, you can add it to your config
                or apply the lifecycle.ignore_changes rule to the metadata.0.annotations field.
                Cloud Run (fully managed) uses the following annotation keys to configure features on a Service:
            args: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Arguments to the entrypoint.
                The docker image's CMD is used if this is not provided.
                Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's
                environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input
                string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a
                double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded,
                regardless of whether the variable exists or not.

                (For legacy support, if template.metadata.name is unset in state while
                this field is set to false, the revision name will still autogenerate.)

                -
                (Optional)
                App instance.
                By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted.
            location: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The location of the queue
            max_attempts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Number of attempts per task.
                Cloud Tasks will attempt the task maxAttempts times (that is, if
                the first attempt fails, then there will be maxAttempts - 1
                retries). Must be >= -1.
                If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick
                the default.
                -1 indicates unlimited attempts.
            max_backoff: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and
                maxBackoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig
                specifies that the task should be retried.
            max_burst_size: |-
                -
                The max burst size.
                Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are
                in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high
                rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits
                resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.
            max_concurrent_dispatches: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to
                be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been
                reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of
                concurrent requests decreases.
            max_dispatches_per_second: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.
                If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.
            max_doublings: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The time between retries will double maxDoublings times.
                A task's retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles maxDoublings times,
                then increases linearly, and finally retries retries at intervals of maxBackoff
                up to maxAttempts times.
            max_retry_duration: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If positive, maxRetryDuration specifies the time limit for
                retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first
                attempted. Once maxRetryDuration time has passed and the task has
                been attempted maxAttempts times, no further attempts will be
                made and the task will be deleted.
                If zero, then the task age is unlimited.
            min_backoff: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and
                maxBackoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig
                specifies that the task should be retried.
            name: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The queue name.

            rate_limits: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Rate limits for task dispatches.
                The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of:
            retry_config: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Settings that determine the retry behavior.
                Structure is documented below.
            sampling_ratio: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Specifies the fraction of operations to write to Stackdriver Logging.
                This field may contain any value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. 0.0 is the
                default and means that no operations are logged.
            service: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                App service.
                By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted.
            stackdriver_logging_config: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                (Optional)
                App version.
                By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted.

                -
                (Optional)
                Whether or not approval is needed. If this is set on a build, it will become pending when run,
                and will need to be explicitly approved to start.
            args: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of arguments that will be presented to the step when it is started.
                If the image used to run the step's container has an entrypoint, the args
                are used as arguments to that entrypoint. If the image does not define an
                entrypoint, the first element in args is used as the entrypoint, and the
                remainder will be used as arguments.

            branch_name: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Regex matching branches to build. Exactly one a of branch name, tag, or commit SHA must be provided.
                The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is the syntax accepted by RE2 and
                described at https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax

                Working directory to use when running this step's container.
                If this value is a relative path, it is relative to the build's working
                directory. If this value is absolute, it may be outside the build's working
                directory, in which case the contents of the path may not be persisted
                across build step executions, unless a volume for that path is specified.
                If the build specifies a RepoSource with dir and a step with a
                dir,
                which specifies an absolute path, the RepoSource dir is ignored
                for the step's execution.

                -
                (Optional)
                Whether the trigger is disabled or not. If true, the trigger will never result in a build.

                (Optional)
                Requested disk size for the VM that runs the build. Note that this is NOT "disk free";
                some of the space will be used by the operating system and build utilities.
                Also note that this is the minimum disk size that will be allocated for the build --
                the build may run with a larger disk than requested. At present, the maximum disk size
                is 1000GB; builds that request more than the maximum are rejected with an error.
            dynamic_substitutions: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Option to specify whether or not to apply bash style string operations to the substitutions.
                NOTE this is always enabled for triggered builds and cannot be overridden in the build configuration file.

                Entrypoint to be used instead of the build step image's
                default entrypoint.
                If unset, the image's default entrypoint is used
            env: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of global environment variable definitions that will exist for all build steps
                in this build. If a variable is defined in both globally and in a build step,
                the variable will use the build step value.
                The elements are of the form "KEY=VALUE" for the environment variable "KEY" being given the value "VALUE".
            filename: |-

                When using Pub/Sub, Webhook or Manual set the file name using git_file_source instead.
            filter: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A Common Expression Language string. Used only with Pub/Sub and Webhook.

                (Optional)
                Google Cloud Storage generation for the object.
                If the generation is omitted, the latest generation will be used
            git_file_source: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The file source describing the local or remote Build template.

            ignored_files: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                ignoredFiles and includedFiles are file glob matches using https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match
                extended with support for **.
                If ignoredFiles and changed files are both empty, then they are not
                used to determine whether or not to trigger a build.
                If ignoredFiles is not empty, then we ignore any files that match any
                of the ignored_file globs. If the change has no files that are outside
                of the ignoredFiles globs, then we do not trigger a build.
            images: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of images to be pushed upon the successful completion of all build steps.
                The images will be pushed using the builder service account's credentials.
                The digests of the pushed images will be stored in the Build resource's results field.
                If any of the images fail to be pushed, the build is marked FAILURE.
            included_files: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                ignoredFiles and includedFiles are file glob matches using https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match
                extended with support for **.
                If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
                and includedFiles is empty, then as far as this filter is concerned, we
                should trigger the build.
                If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
                and includedFiles is not empty, then we make sure that at least one of
                those files matches a includedFiles glob. If not, then we do not trigger

                (Required)
                The configuration parameters for the autoscaling algorithm. You can
                define one or more of the policies for an autoscaler: cpuUtilization,
                customMetricUtilizations, and loadBalancingUtilization.
                If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based
                on cpuUtilization to 0.6 or 60%.
                Structure is documented below.
            cooldown_period: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it
                starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents
                the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
                initializing, during which the collected usage would not be
                reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.
                Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
                numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
                instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
                and time the startup process.
            cpu_utilization: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Defines the CPU utilization policy that allows the autoscaler to
                scale based on the average CPU utilization of a managed instance
                group.

                A boolean value that specifies if a scaling schedule can influence autoscaler recommendations. If set to true, then a scaling schedule has no effect.

            filter: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                is exporting per-instance or per-group data.
                You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
                any functions for each selector.
                You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                be identical.
                The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                labels.
                If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.
                If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.
                You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
                TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

                (Optional)
                Scaling schedules defined for an autoscaler. Multiple schedules can be set on an autoscaler and they can overlap.
                Structure is documented below.
            schedule: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The start timestamps of time intervals when this scaling schedule should provide a scaling signal. This field uses the extended cron format (with an optional year field).
            self_link: '- The URI of the created resource.'
            single_instance_assignment: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the
                total amount of work to be done or resource usage, set this value to
                an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
                The autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
                value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                to group resizing.
                For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages
                or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to
                your instances.
                A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
                instead.
            target: |-

                This field can only be specified if logging is enabled for this backend service. The value of
                the field must be in [0, 1]. This configures the sampling rate of requests to the load balancer
                where 1.0 means all logged requests are reported and 0.0 means no logged requests are reported.

                The security settings that apply to this backend service. This field is applicable to either
                a regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and
                load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED; or a global backend service with the
                load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

                -
                (Optional)
                Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE. Session affinity is
                not applicable if the protocol is UDP.
                Possible values are NONE, CLIENT_IP, CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO, CLIENT_IP_PROTO, GENERATED_COOKIE, HEADER_FIELD, and HTTP_COOKIE.
            signed_url_cache_max_age_sec: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request
                will be considered fresh, defaults to 1hr (3600s). After this
                time period, the response will be revalidated before
                being served.
                When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
                internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
                "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
                existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in
                responses will not be altered.
            subject_alt_names: |-
                -
                (Required)
                A list of alternate names to verify the subject identity in the certificate.
                If specified, the client will verify that the server certificate's subject
                alt name matches one of the specified values.
            success_rate_minimum_hosts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The number of hosts in a cluster that must have enough request volume to detect
                success rate outliers. If the number of hosts is less than this setting, outlier
                detection via success rate statistics is not performed for any host in the
                cluster. Defaults to 5.
            success_rate_request_volume: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The minimum number of total requests that must be collected in one interval (as
                defined by the interval duration above) to include this host in success rate
                based outlier detection. If the volume is lower than this setting, outlier
                detection via success rate statistics is not performed for that host. Defaults
                to 100.
            success_rate_stdev_factor: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier
                ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success
                rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean
                success rate: mean - (stdev * success_rate_stdev_factor). This factor is divided
                by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the
                runtime value should be 1900. Defaults to 1900.
            timeout_sec: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                How many seconds to wait for the backend before considering it a
                failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is [1, 86400].
            ttl: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The TTL (in seconds) for which to cache responses with the corresponding status code. The maximum allowed value is 1800s
                (30 minutes), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
            update: '- Default is 20 minutes.'

                one at a time. Use
                google_compute_disk_resource_policy_attachment
                to allow for updating the resource policy attached to the disk.
            self_link: '- The URI of the created resource.'
            sha256: |-
                -
                The RFC 4648 base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the customer-supplied
                encryption key that protects this resource.
            size: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this
                field when creating a persistent disk using the image or
                snapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty
                persistent disk.
                If you specify this field along with image or snapshot,
                the value must not be less than the size of the image
                or the size of the snapshot.
                ~>NOTE If you change the size, Terraform updates the disk size
                if upsizing is detected but recreates the disk if downsizing is requested.
                You can add lifecycle.prevent_destroy in the config to prevent destroying
                and recreating.
            snapshot: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as
                a partial or full URL to the resource. If the snapshot is in another
                project than this disk, you must supply a full URL. For example, the
                following are valid values:
            source_image_encryption_key: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The customer-supplied encryption key of the source image. Required if
                the source image is protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.
                Structure is documented below.
            source_image_id: |-
                -
                The ID value of the image used to create this disk. This value
                identifies the exact image that was used to create this persistent
                disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an image
                that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
                image ID would identify the exact version of the image that was used.
            source_snapshot_encryption_key: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The customer-supplied encryption key of the source snapshot. Required
                if the source snapshot is protected by a customer-supplied encryption
                key.
                Structure is documented below.
            source_snapshot_id: |-
                -
                The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value
                identifies the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent
                disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot
                that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
                snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was
                used.

            priority: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both
                inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative
                priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of
                priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has
                higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take
                precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.

                If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to
                traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must
                be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and
                sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will
                apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
                source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The
                connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to
                apply. Only IPv4 is supported. For INGRESS traffic, one of source_ranges,
                source_tags or source_service_accounts is required.
            source_service_accounts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only
                to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this
                list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an
                instance's external IP address because service accounts are associated
                with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the
                same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will
                apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
                source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in
                sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both
                properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be
                used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags. For INGRESS traffic,
                one of source_ranges, source_tags or source_service_accounts is required.
            source_tags: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If source tags are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic
                with source IP that belongs to a tag listed in source tags. Source
                tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP
                address. Because tags are associated with an instance, not an IP
                address. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If
                both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has
                source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to
                a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need
                to match both properties for the firewall to apply. For INGRESS traffic,
                one of source_ranges, source_tags or source_service_accounts is required.

                targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or
                sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are
                specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified
                network.

                This field can be used with internal load balancer or network load balancer
                when the forwarding rule references a backend service, or with the target
                field when it references a TargetInstance. Set this to true to
                allow packets addressed to any ports to be forwarded to the backends configured
                with this forwarding rule. This can be used when the protocol is TCP/UDP, and it
                must be set to true when the protocol is set to L3_DEFAULT.
                Cannot be set if port or portRange are set.

            ip_address: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
                traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
                the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
                loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
                type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
                to IP address specifications.
                An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
                reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
                reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
                The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
                that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
                For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
                Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
            ip_protocol: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The IP protocol to which this rule applies.
                When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are
                valid.
                Possible values are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP, and L3_DEFAULT.
            is_mirroring_collector: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used
                as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops,
                instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic
                mirrored even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This
                can only be set to true for load balancers that have their
                loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
            label_fingerprint: |-
                -

                internally during updates.
            labels: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
            load_balancing_scheme: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can be
                EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, or INTERNAL_MANAGED. EXTERNAL is used for Classic
                Cloud VPN gateways, protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP address,
                and HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
                INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,
                and internal TCP/UDP load balancers.
                EXTERNAL_MANAGED is used for regional external HTTP(S) load balancers.
                INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP(S) load balancers.
                Default value is EXTERNAL.
                Possible values are EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, and INTERNAL_MANAGED.
            name: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
                the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.

                -
                (Optional)
                For internal load balancing, this field identifies the network that
                the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If
                this field is not specified, the default network will be used.
                This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
            network_tier: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The networking tier used for configuring this address. If this field is not
                specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
                Possible values are PREMIUM and STANDARD.
            port_range: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
                TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
                TargetPool, TargetInstance.
                Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
                addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
                Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
                disjoint port ranges.
                Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
                ports:
            ports: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This field is used along with internal load balancing and network
                load balancer when the forwarding rule references a backend service
                and when protocol is not L3_DEFAULT.
                A single port or a comma separated list of ports can be configured.
                Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the backends
                configured with this forwarding rule.
                You can only use one of ports and portRange, or allPorts.
                The three are mutually exclusive.
                You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports, which can be non-contiguous.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.

            ip_address: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
                traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
                the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
                loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
                type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
                to IP address specifications.
                An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
                reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
                reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
                The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
                that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
                For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
                Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
            ip_protocol: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The IP protocol to which this rule applies. When the load balancing scheme is
                INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, only TCP is valid. This field must not be set if the
                global address is configured as a purpose of PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT
                and addressType of INTERNAL
                Possible values are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, and ICMP.
            ip_version: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The IP Version that will be used by this global forwarding rule.
                Possible values are IPV4 and IPV6.
            label_fingerprint: |-
                -
                (Beta)
                The fingerprint used for optimistic locking of this resource.  Used
                internally during updates.
            labels: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                Labels to apply to this forwarding rule.  A list of key->value pairs.
            load_balancing_scheme: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This signifies what the GlobalForwardingRule will be used for.
                The value of INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED means that this will be used for
                Internal Global HTTP(S) LB. The value of EXTERNAL means that this
                will be used for External Global Load Balancing (HTTP(S) LB,
                External TCP/UDP LB, SSL Proxy). The value of EXTERNAL_MANAGED means
                that this will be used for Global external HTTP(S) load balancers.
                (Beta only) Note: This field must be set "" if the global address is
                configured as a purpose of PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT and addressType of INTERNAL.
                Default value is EXTERNAL.
                Possible values are EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, and INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
            metadata_filters: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing
                configuration to a limited set xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
                requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. If a
                match takes place, the relevant routing configuration is made available
                to those proxies.
                For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set
                to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the
                corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria
                is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with
                corresponding labels in the provided metadata.
                metadataFilters specified here can be overridden by those specified in
                the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references.
                metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their
                loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
                Structure is documented below.
            name: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Name of the metadata label. The length must be between
                1 and 1024 characters, inclusive.
            network: |-
                -

                This field is not used for external load balancing.
                For INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, this field
                identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to
                for this global forwarding rule. If this field is not specified,
                the default network will be used.
            port_range: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                - (Optional) An array of IPv6 access configurations for this interface.
                Currently, only one IPv6 access config, DIRECT_IPV6, is supported. If there is no ipv6AccessConfig
                specified, then this instance will have no external IPv6 Internet access. Structure documented below.
            ipv6_access_type: |-
                - One of EXTERNAL, INTERNAL to indicate whether the IP can be accessed from the Internet.
                This field is always inherited from its subnetwork.

                - (Optional) An alternative to using the
                startup-script metadata key, except this one forces the instance to be recreated
                (thus re-running the script) if it is changed. This replaces the startup-script
                metadata key on the created instance and thus the two mechanisms are not
                allowed to be used simultaneously.  Users are free to use either mechanism - the
                only distinction is that this separate attribute will cause a recreate on
                modification.  On import, metadata_startup_script will not be set - if you
                choose to specify it you will see a diff immediately after import causing a
                destroy/recreate operation. If importing an instance and specifying this value
                is desired, you will need to modify your state file manually using
                terraform state commands.

            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the project will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no project is provided in the parent identifier and no project is specified, the provider project is used.
            role: |-
                - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
                google_compute_instance_iam_binding can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
                [projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}.
            title: '- (Required) A title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose.'
            zone: |-
                - (Optional) A reference to the zone where the machine resides. Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to. If not specified,
                the value will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no zone is provided in the parent identifier and no
                zone is specified, it is taken from the provider configuration.

                - (Optional) The size of the image in gigabytes. If not
                specified, it will inherit the size of its base image. For SCRATCH disks,
                the size must be exactly 375GB.
            disk_type: |-
                - (Optional) The GCE disk type. Such as "pd-ssd", "local-ssd",

                - (Optional) Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk,
                which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. Persistent disks must always use SCSI
                and the request will fail if you attempt to attach a persistent disk in any other format
                than SCSI. Local SSDs can use either NVME or SCSI.
            ip_cidr_range: |-
                - The IP CIDR range represented by this alias IP range. This IP CIDR range
                must belong to the specified subnetwork and cannot contain IP addresses reserved by
                system or used by other network interfaces. At the time of writing only a
                netmask (e.g. /24) may be supplied, with a CIDR format resulting in an API
                error.
            ipv6_access_config: |-
                - (Optional) An array of IPv6 access configurations for this interface.
                Currently, only one IPv6 access config, DIRECT_IPV6, is supported. If there is no ipv6AccessConfig
                specified, then this instance will have no external IPv6 Internet access. Structure documented below.
            key: '- (Required) Corresponds to the label key of a reservation resource. To target a SPECIFIC_RESERVATION by name, specify compute.googleapis.com/reservation-name as the key and specify the name of your reservation as the only value.'

                this template
            machine_type: '- (Required) The machine type to create.'
            metadata: |-
                - (Optional) Metadata key/value pairs to make available from
                within instances created from this template.
            metadata_fingerprint: '- The unique fingerprint of the metadata.'

                attachment:
                NONE is the default value, which means that the attachment carries
                unencrypted traffic. VMs can send traffic to, or receive traffic
                from, this type of attachment.
                IPSEC indicates that the attachment carries only traffic encrypted by
                an IPsec device such as an HA VPN gateway. VMs cannot directly send
                traffic to, or receive traffic from, such an attachment. To use
                IPsec-encrypted Cloud Interconnect create the attachment using this
                option.
                Not currently available publicly.

                encryption option as IPSEC.
                The addresses must be RFC 1918 IP address ranges. When creating HA
                VPN gateway over the interconnect attachment, if the attachment is
                configured to use an RFC 1918 IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP
                address will be allocated from the IP address range specified

            autoscaling_policy: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The configuration parameters for the autoscaling algorithm. You can
                define one or more of the policies for an autoscaler: cpuUtilization,
                customMetricUtilizations, and loadBalancingUtilization.
                If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based
                on cpuUtilization to 0.6 or 60%.
                Structure is documented below.
            cooldown_period: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it
                starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents
                the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
                initializing, during which the collected usage would not be
                reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.
                Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
                numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
                instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
                and time the startup process.
            cpu_utilization: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Defines the CPU utilization policy that allows the autoscaler to
                scale based on the average CPU utilization of a managed instance
                group.
                Structure is documented below.
            create: '- Default is 20 minutes.'
            creation_timestamp: |-
                -
                Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
            delete: '- Default is 20 minutes.'
            description: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                An optional description of this resource.
            disabled: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A boolean value that specifies if a scaling schedule can influence autoscaler recommendations. If set to true, then a scaling schedule has no effect.
            duration_sec: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The duration of time intervals (in seconds) for which this scaling schedule will be running. The minimum allowed value is 300.
            filter: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                is exporting per-instance or per-group data.
                You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
                any functions for each selector.
                You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                be identical.
                The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                labels.
                If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.
                If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.
                You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
                TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

                The maximum number of instances that the autoscaler can scale up
                to. This is required when creating or updating an autoscaler. The

                Defines scale in controls to reduce the risk of response latency
                and outages due to abrupt scale-in events
                Structure is documented below.

                -
                (Optional)
                Scaling schedules defined for an autoscaler. Multiple schedules can be set on an autoscaler and they can overlap.
                Structure is documented below.
            schedule: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The start timestamps of time intervals when this scaling schedule should provide a scaling signal. This field uses the extended cron format (with an optional year field).
            self_link: '- The URI of the created resource.'
            single_instance_assignment: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the
                total amount of work to be done or resource usage, set this value to
                an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
                The autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
                value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                to group resizing.
                For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages
                or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to
                your instances.
                A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
                instead.
            target: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Fraction of backend capacity utilization (set in HTTP(s) load
                balancing configuration) that autoscaler should maintain. Must
                be a positive float value. If not defined, the default is 0.8.
            time_window_sec: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                How long back autoscaling should look when computing recommendations
                to include directives regarding slower scale down, as described above.
            time_zone: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The time zone to be used when interpreting the schedule. The value of this field must be a time zone name from the tz database: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database.
            type: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Defines how target utilization value is expressed for a
                Stackdriver Monitoring metric.
                Possible values are GAUGE, DELTA_PER_SECOND, and DELTA_PER_MINUTE.

            connection_persistence_on_unhealthy_backends: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies connection persistence when backends are unhealthy.
                If set to DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL, the existing connections persist on
                unhealthy backends only for connection-oriented protocols (TCP and SCTP)
                and only if the Tracking Mode is PER_CONNECTION (default tracking mode)
                or the Session Affinity is configured for 5-tuple. They do not persist
                for UDP.
                If set to NEVER_PERSIST, after a backend becomes unhealthy, the existing
                connections on the unhealthy backend are never persisted on the unhealthy
                backend. They are always diverted to newly selected healthy backends
                (unless all backends are unhealthy).
                If set to ALWAYS_PERSIST, existing connections always persist on
                unhealthy backends regardless of protocol and session affinity. It is
                generally not recommended to use this mode overriding the default.
                Default value is DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL.
                Possible values are DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL, NEVER_PERSIST, and ALWAYS_PERSIST.

                errors that are mapped to one of those status codes) before a consecutive
                gateway failure ejection occurs. Defaults to 5.
            consistent_hash: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session
                affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
                policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
                destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
                destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
                hashing.
                This field only applies when all of the following are true -

            disable_connection_drain_on_failover: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                On failover or failback, this field indicates whether connection drain
                will be honored. Setting this to true has the following effect: connections
                to the old active pool are not drained. Connections to the new active pool
                use the timeout of 10 min (currently fixed). Setting to false has the
                following effect: both old and new connections will have a drain timeout
                of 10 min.
                This can be set to true only if the protocol is TCP.
                The default is false.

                This option is used only when no healthy VMs are detected in the primary
                and backup instance groups. When set to true, traffic is dropped. When
                set to false, new connections are sent across all VMs in the primary group.
                The default is false.
            enable: |-
                -

            enforcing_success_rate: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
                status is detected through success rate statistics. This setting can be used to
                disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
            failover: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More
                than one failover backend can be configured for a given RegionBackendService.
            failover_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Policy for failovers.

            failover_ratio: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. If the ratio of the healthy
                VMs in the primary backend is at or below this number, traffic arriving
                at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the failover backend.
                In case where 'failoverRatio' is not set or all the VMs in the backup
                backend are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary
                backend in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy
                VMs with the best effort, or to all VMs when no VM is healthy.
                This field is only used with l4 load balancing.

                (Required)
                The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
                of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
                instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
                the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
                are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
                For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
                endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
                located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
                Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
                Network Endpoint Group backends.
                When the load_balancing_scheme is INTERNAL, only instance groups
                are supported.
                Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
                partial URL.

                according to query_string_whitelist and
                query_string_blacklist. If neither is set, the entire query
                string will be included.
                If false, the query string will be excluded from the cache
                key entirely.

                defined by the interval duration above) to include this host in success rate
                based outlier detection. If the volume is lower than this setting, outlier
                detection via success rate statistics is not performed for that host. Defaults
                to 100.
            success_rate_stdev_factor: |-
                -

                ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success
                rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean
                success rate: mean - (stdev * success_rate_stdev_factor). This factor is divided
                by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the
                runtime value should be 1900. Defaults to 1900.
            timeout_sec: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                Specifies the key used for connection tracking. There are two options:
                PER_CONNECTION: The Connection Tracking is performed as per the
                Connection Key (default Hash Method) for the specific protocol.
                PER_SESSION: The Connection Tracking is performed as per the
                configured Session Affinity. It matches the configured Session Affinity.
                Default value is PER_CONNECTION.
                Possible values are PER_CONNECTION and PER_SESSION.
            ttl: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                The TTL (in seconds) for which to cache responses with the corresponding status code. The maximum allowed value is 1800s
                (30 minutes), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
            update: '- Default is 20 minutes.'

            disk_encryption_key: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.
                After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must
                provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk
                snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).
                Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
                the disk.
                If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
                the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and
                you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.
                Structure is documented below.

                Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
                the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.
            physical_block_size_bytes: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Physical block size of the persistent disk, in bytes. If not present
                in a request, a default value is used. Currently supported sizes

                encryption key that protects this resource.
            size: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this
                field when creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage or
                sourceSnapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty
                persistent disk.
                If you specify this field along with sourceImage or sourceSnapshot,
                the value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the sourceImage
                or the size of the snapshot.
            snapshot: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as
                a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the following are
                valid values:
            source_snapshot_encryption_key: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The customer-supplied encryption key of the source snapshot. Required
                if the source snapshot is protected by a customer-supplied encryption
                key.
                Structure is documented below.
            source_snapshot_id: |-
                -
                The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value
                identifies the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent
                disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot
                that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
                snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was
                used.
            type: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                - (Optional) Whether to wait for all instances to be created/updated before
                returning. Note that if this is set to true and the operation does not succeed, Terraform will
                continue trying until it times out.
            wait_for_instances_status: |-
                - (Optional) When used with wait_for_instances it specifies the status to wait for.
                When STABLE is specified this resource will wait until the instances are stable before returning. When UPDATED is
                set, it will wait for the version target to be reached and any per instance configs to be effective as well as all
                instances to be stable before returning. The possible values are STABLE and UPDATED

                retaining the remaining portion of the URL before redirecting the request.
                prefixRedirect cannot be supplied together with pathRedirect. Supply one alone or
                neither. If neither is supplied, the path of the original request will be used for
                the redirect. The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters.
            present_match: |-
                -

                For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                that matches the request is applied.
                You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
                2147483647 inclusive.
                Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                future without any impact on existing rules.

                Specifies the fraction of traffic sent to backendService, computed as weight /
                (sum of all weightedBackendService weights in routeAction) . The selection of a
                backend service is determined only for new traffic. Once a user's request has
                been directed to a backendService, subsequent requests will be sent to the same
                backendService as determined by the BackendService's session affinity policy.
                The value must be between 0 and 1000
            weighted_backend_services: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match
                occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their
                corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend
                service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
                number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
                the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header
                transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this
                HttpRouteAction.

                Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035.  Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and
                match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means
                the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the
                last character, which cannot be a dash.
            network: |-
                -

                -
                (Optional)
                URL to a gateway that should handle matching packets.
                Currently, you can only specify the internet gateway, using a full or
                partial valid URL:
            next_hop_ilb: |-
                -

                The IP address or URL to a forwarding rule of type
                loadBalancingScheme=INTERNAL that should handle matching
                packets.
                With the GA provider you can only specify the forwarding
                rule as a partial or full URL. For example, the following
                are all valid values:
            next_hop_instance: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                URL to an instance that should handle matching packets.
                You can specify this as a full or partial URL. For example:
            next_hop_instance_zone: |-
                - (Optional when next_hop_instance is
                specified)  The zone of the instance specified in

                -
                (Optional)
                The priority of this route. Priority is used to break ties in cases
                where there is more than one matching route of equal prefix length.
                In the case of two routes with equal prefix length, the one with the
                lowest-numbered priority value wins.
                Default value is 1000. Valid range is 0 through 65535.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.

                the urlMap may be accessed by gRPC applications without using
                a sidecar proxy. This will enable configuration checks on urlMap
                and its referenced BackendServices to not allow unsupported features.
                A gRPC application must use "xds:///" scheme in the target URI

                The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the resiliency of clients to backend service failure.
                As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by Loadbalancer on a
                percentage of requests before sending those request to the backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted
                by the Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests.

            num_retries: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the allowed number retries. This number must be > 0. If not specified, defaults to 1.
            path: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Path portion of the URL.
            path_matcher: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The name of the PathMatcher to use to match the path portion of the URL if the
                hostRule matches the URL's host portion.
            path_prefix_rewrite: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Prior to forwarding the request to the selected backend service, the matching portion of the
                request's path is replaced by pathPrefixRewrite.
                The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters.
            path_redirect: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                supplied in the request. pathRedirect cannot be supplied together with
                prefixRedirect. Supply one alone or neither. If neither is supplied, the path of the
                original request will be used for the redirect. The value must be between 1 and 1024
                characters.
            path_rule: |-

                (Optional)
                The list of path rules. Use this list instead of routeRules when routing based
                on simple path matching is all that's required. The order by which path rules
                are specified does not matter. Matches are always done on the longest-path-first
                basis. For example: a pathRule with a path /a/b/c/* will match before /a/b/*
                irrespective of the order in which those paths appear in this list. Within a
                given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or routeRules must be set.
                Structure is documented below.
            paths: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The list of path patterns to match. Each must start with / and the only place a

                does not include any text after the first ? or #, and those chars are not
                allowed here.
            per_try_timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies a non-zero timeout per retry attempt.
                If not specified, will use the timeout set in HttpRouteAction. If timeout in HttpRouteAction is not set,

                Structure is documented below.
            percentage: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The percentage of traffic (connections/operations/requests) which will be aborted as part of fault injection.
                The value must be between 0.0 and 100.0 inclusive.
            prefix_match: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The value of the header must start with the contents of prefixMatch. Only one of

            prefix_redirect: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The prefix that replaces the prefixMatch specified in the HttpRouteRuleMatch,
                retaining the remaining portion of the URL before redirecting the request.
                prefixRedirect cannot be supplied together with pathRedirect. Supply one alone or
                neither. If neither is supplied, the path of the original request will be used for
                the redirect. The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters.
            present_match: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies that the queryParameterMatch matches if the request contains the query
                parameter, irrespective of whether the parameter has a value or not. Only one of
                presentMatch, exactMatch and regexMatch must be set.
            priority: |-
                -
                (Required)
                For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                that matches the request is applied.
                You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
                2147483647 inclusive.
                Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                future without any impact on existing rules.

                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies a list of query parameter match criteria, all of which must match
                corresponding query parameters in the request.
                Structure is documented below.
            range_end: |-
                -
                (Required)

            range_match: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The header value must be an integer and its value must be in the range specified
                in rangeMatch. If the header does not contain an integer, number or is empty,
                the match fails. For example for a range [-5, 0]   - -3 will match.  - 0 will
                not match.  - 0.25 will not match.  - -3someString will not match.   Only one of
                exactMatch, prefixMatch, suffixMatch, regexMatch, presentMatch or rangeMatch
                must be set.
                Structure is documented below.

                (Optional)
                The queryParameterMatch matches if the value of the parameter matches the
                regular expression specified by regexMatch. For the regular expression grammar,
                please see en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript  Only one of presentMatch,
                exactMatch and regexMatch must be set.

                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the route's backends are shadowed to a separate mirrored backend service.
                Loadbalancer does not wait for responses from the shadow service. Prior to sending traffic to the shadow service,
                the host / authority header is suffixed with -shadow.
                Structure is documented below.

            route_action: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer performs advanced routing
                actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
                request to the selected backend. If  routeAction specifies any
                weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely if service is set,
                routeAction cannot contain any  weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction

                The list of ordered HTTP route rules. Use this list instead of pathRules when
                advanced route matching and routing actions are desired. The order of specifying
                routeRules matters: the first rule that matches will cause its specified routing
                action to take effect. Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or
                routeRules must be set. routeRules are not supported in UrlMaps intended for
                External load balancers.
                Structure is documented below.
            seconds: |-

                (Required)
                If set to true, any accompanying query portion of the original URL is removed prior
                to redirecting the request. If set to false, the query portion of the original URL is
                retained. The default is set to false.
                This field is required to ensure an empty block is not set. The normal default value is false.

                Structure is documented below.
            timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time the request has been
                fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream) up until the response has been completely processed. Timeout includes all retries.
                If not specified, will use the largest timeout among all backend services associated with the route.
                Structure is documented below.

                set.
                Structure is documented below.
            url_rewrite: |-

                Specifies the fraction of traffic sent to backendService, computed as
                weight / (sum of all weightedBackendService weights in routeAction) .
                The selection of a backend service is determined only for new traffic. Once a user's request
                has been directed to a backendService, subsequent requests will be sent to the same backendService
                as determined by the BackendService's session affinity policy.
                The value must be between 0 and 1000
            weighted_backend_services: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match occurs.
                The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their corresponding backend service.
                If all traffic needs to go to a single backend service, there must be one weightedBackendService
                with weight set to a non 0 number.
                Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to the backend service,
                advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header transformations are applied depending on
                additional settings specified in this HttpRouteAction.

                Note kind that represents a logical attestation "role" or "authority".
                For example, an organization might have one AttestationAuthority for
                "QA" and one for "build". This Note is intended to act strictly as a
                grouping mechanism for the attached Occurrences (Attestations). This
                grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs
                gate the ability for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given
                Note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached
                Attestation Occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same
                project.

                This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of
                the AttestationAuthority. Because the name of a Note acts as its
                resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical
                name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes)
                from "readable" names more suitable for debug output. Note that
                these hints should NOT be used to look up AttestationAuthorities
                in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up
                Attestations to verify.

                Occurrence that represents a single "attestation". The authenticity
                of an attestation can be verified using the attached signature.
                If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying

                signature. MUST be an RFC3986 conformant
                URI. * When possible, the key id should be an
                immutable reference, such as a cryptographic digest.

            resource_uri: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Required. Immutable. A URI that represents the resource for which
                the occurrence applies. For example,
                https://gcr.io/project/image@sha256:123abc for a Docker image.
            serialized_payload: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The serialized payload that is verified by one or
                more signatures. A base64-encoded string.
            signature: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The content of the signature, an opaque bytestring.
                The payload that this signature verifies MUST be
                unambiguously provided with the Signature during
                verification. A wrapper message might provide the
                payload explicitly. Alternatively, a message might
                have a canonical serialization that can always be
                unambiguously computed to derive the payload.
            signatures: |-
                -
                (Required)
                One or more signatures over serializedPayload.
                Verifier implementations should consider this attestation
                message verified if at least one signature verifies
                serializedPayload. See Signature in common.proto for more
                details on signature structure and verification.

                master will be created, as well as the default node location. If you specify a
                zone (such as us-central1-a), the cluster will be a zonal cluster with a
                single cluster master. If you specify a region (such as us-west1), the
                cluster will be a regional cluster with multiple masters spread across zones in
                the region, and with default node locations in those zones as well
            logging_config: |-
                - (Optional) Logging configuration for the cluster.

            master_auth: |-
                - (Optional) The authentication information for accessing the
                Kubernetes master. Some values in this block are only returned by the API if
                your service account has permission to get credentials for your GKE cluster. If
                you see an unexpected diff unsetting your client cert, ensure you have the
                container.clusters.getCredentials permission.
                Structure is documented below.
            master_auth.0.client_certificate: |-
                - Base64 encoded public certificate
                used by clients to authenticate to the cluster endpoint.

                to authenticate to the cluster endpoint.
            master_auth.0.cluster_ca_certificate: |-
                - Base64 encoded public certificate
                that is the root certificate of the cluster.
            master_authorized_networks_config: |-
                - (Optional) The desired
                configuration options for master authorized networks. Omit the
                nested cidr_blocks attribute to disallow external access (except
                the cluster node IPs, which GKE automatically whitelists).
                Structure is documented below.
            master_global_access_config: |-
                (Optional) - Controls cluster master global
                access settings. If unset, Terraform will no longer manage this field and will
                not modify the previously-set value. Structure is documented below.
            master_ipv4_cidr_block: |-
                (Optional) - The IP range in CIDR notation to use for
                the hosted master network. This range will be used for assigning private IP
                addresses to the cluster master(s) and the ILB VIP. This range must not overlap
                with any other ranges in use within the cluster's network, and it must be a /28
                subnet. See Private Cluster Limitations
                for more details. This field only applies to private clusters, when
                enable_private_nodes is true.
            master_version: |-
                - The current version of the master in the cluster. This may
                be different than the min_master_version set in the config if the master
                has been updated by GKE.
            maximum: '- (Optional) Maximum amount of the resource in the cluster.'
            metadata: |-
                - (Optional) The metadata key/value pairs assigned to instances in
                the cluster. From GKE 1.12 onwards, disable-legacy-endpoints is set to
                true by the API; if metadata is set but that default value is not
                included, Terraform will attempt to unset the value. To avoid this, set the
                value in your config.
            min_cpu_platform: |-
                - (Optional) Minimum CPU platform to be used by this instance.
                The instance may be scheduled on the specified or newer CPU platform. Applicable
                values are the friendly names of CPU platforms, such as Intel Haswell. See the
                official documentation
                for more information.
            min_master_version: |-
                - (Optional) The minimum version of the master. GKE
                will auto-update the master to new versions, so this does not guarantee the
                current master version--use the read-only master_version field to obtain that.
                If unset, the cluster's version will be set by GKE to the version of the most recent
                official release (which is not necessarily the latest version).  Most users will find
                the google_container_engine_versions data source useful - it indicates which versions
                are available, and can be use to approximate fuzzy versions in a
                Terraform-compatible way. If you intend to specify versions manually,
                the docs
                describe the various acceptable formats for this field.
            minimum: '- (Optional) Minimum amount of the resource in the cluster.'
            mode: |-
                (Required) How to expose the node metadata to the workload running on the node.
                Accepted values are:
            monitoring_config: |-
                - (Optional) Monitoring configuration for the cluster.
                Structure is documented below.
            monitoring_service: |-
                - (Optional) The monitoring service that the cluster
                should write metrics to.
                Automatically send metrics from pods in the cluster to the Google Cloud Monitoring API.
                VM metrics will be collected by Google Compute Engine regardless of this setting
                Available options include
                monitoring.googleapis.com(Legacy Stackdriver), monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes(Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring), and none.

            network_config: |-
                -  (Optional, Beta) Configuration for
                Adding Pod IP address ranges) to the node pool. Structure is documented below
            network_policy: |-
                - (Optional) Configuration options for the

                - (Optional) Whether we should enable the network policy addon
                for the master.  This must be enabled in order to enable network policy for the nodes.
                To enable this, you must also define a network_policy block,
                otherwise nothing will happen.
                It can only be disabled if the nodes already do not have network policies enabled.
                Defaults to disabled; set disabled = false to enable.
            networking_mode: |-
                - (Optional) Determines whether alias IPs or routes will be used for pod IPs in the cluster.
                Options are VPC_NATIVE or ROUTES. VPC_NATIVE enables IP aliasing,
                and requires the ip_allocation_policy block to be defined. By default, when this field is unspecified and no ip_allocation_policy blocks are set, GKE will create a ROUTES-based cluster.
            node_config: |-
                -  (Optional) Parameters used in creating the default node pool.
                Generally, this field should not be used at the same time as a
                google_container_node_pool or a node_pool block; this configuration
                manages the default node pool, which isn't recommended to be used with
                Terraform. Structure is documented below.
            node_group: '- (Optional) Setting this field will assign instances of this pool to run on the specified node group. This is useful for running workloads on sole tenant nodes.'
            node_locations: |-
                - (Optional) The list of zones in which the cluster's nodes
                are located. Nodes must be in the region of their regional cluster or in the
                same region as their cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If this is specified for
                a zonal cluster, omit the cluster's zone.
            node_pool: |-
                - (Optional) List of node pools associated with this cluster.
                See google_container_node_pool for schema.
                Warning: node pools defined inside a cluster can't be changed (or added/removed) after
                cluster creation without deleting and recreating the entire cluster. Unless you absolutely need the ability
                to say "these are the only node pools associated with this cluster", use the
                google_container_node_pool resource instead of this property.
            node_version: |-
                - (Optional) The Kubernetes version on the nodes. Must either be unset
                or set to the same value as min_master_version on create. Defaults to the default
                version set by GKE which is not necessarily the latest version. This only affects
                nodes in the default node pool. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
                recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
                when fuzzy versions are used. See the google_container_engine_versions data source's
                version_prefix field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.
                To update nodes in other node pools, use the version attribute on the node pool.
            notification_config: '- (Optional, Beta) Configuration for the cluster upgrade notifications feature. Structure is documented below.'
            oauth_scopes: |-
                - (Optional) The set of Google API scopes to be made available
                on all of the node VMs under the "default" service account.
                Use the "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform" scope to grant access to all APIs. It is recommended that you set service_account to a non-default service account and grant IAM roles to that service account for only the resources that it needs.
            peering_name: '- The name of the peering between this cluster and the Google owned VPC.'
            pod_ipv4_cidr_block: '- (Optional, Beta) The IP address range for pod IPs in this node pool. Only applicable if createPodRange is true. Set to blank to have a range chosen with the default size. Set to /netmask (e.g. /14) to have a range chosen with a specific netmask. Set to a CIDR notation (e.g. 10.96.0.0/14) to pick a specific range to use.'
            pod_range: '- (Optional, Beta) The ID of the secondary range for pod IPs. If create_pod_range is true, this ID is used for the new range. If create_pod_range is false, uses an existing secondary range with this ID.'

                - (Optional)
                The desired state of IPv6 connectivity to Google Services. By default, no private IPv6 access to or from Google Services (all access will be via IPv4).

                - (Optional)
                Configuration options for the Release channel
                feature, which provide more control over automatic upgrades of your GKE clusters.
                When updating this field, GKE imposes specific version requirements. See
                Selecting a new release channel
                for more details; the google_container_engine_versions datasource can provide
                the default version for a channel. Note that removing the release_channel
                field from your config will cause Terraform to stop managing your cluster's
                release channel, but will not unenroll it. Instead, use the "UNSPECIFIED"
                channel. Structure is documented below.
            remove_default_node_pool: |-
                - (Optional) If true, deletes the default node
                pool upon cluster creation. If you're using google_container_node_pool
                resources with no default node pool, this should be set to true, alongside
                setting initial_node_count to at least 1.

                and all pods running on the nodes. Specified as a map from the key, such as
                net.core.wmem_max, to a string value.
            tags: |-
                - (Optional) The list of instance tags applied to all nodes. Tags are used to identify
                valid sources or targets for network firewalls.
            taint: |-
                - (Optional) A list of Kubernetes taints
                to apply to nodes. GKE's API can only set this field on cluster creation.
                However, GKE will add taints to your nodes if you enable certain features such
                as GPUs. If this field is set, any diffs on this field will cause Terraform to
                recreate the underlying resource. Taint values can be updated safely in
                Kubernetes (eg. through kubectl), and it's recommended that you do not use
                this field to manage taints. If you do, lifecycle.ignore_changes is
                recommended. Structure is documented below.
            topic: '(Optional) - The pubsub topic to push upgrade notifications to. Must be in the same project as the cluster. Must be in the format: projects/{project}/topics/{topic}.'
            tpu_ipv4_cidr_block: |-
                - The IP address range of the Cloud TPUs in this cluster, in
                CIDR
                notation (e.g. 1.2.3.4/29).
            type: (Required) - The accelerator type resource to expose to this instance. E.g. nvidia-tesla-k80.
            update: '- Default is 60 minutes.'
            value: (Required) Value for taint.
            vertical_pod_autoscaling: |-
                - (Optional, Beta)
                Vertical Pod Autoscaling automatically adjusts the resources of pods controlled by it.
                Structure is documented below.
            workload_identity_config: |-
                - (Optional)
                Workload Identity allows Kubernetes service accounts to act as a user-managed
                Google IAM Service Account.
                Structure is documented below.
            workload_metadata_config: |-
                - (Optional) Metadata configuration to expose to workloads on the node pool.
                Structure is documented below.
            workload_pool: (Optional) - The workload pool to attach all Kubernetes service accounts to.

            initial_node_count: |-
                - (Optional) The initial number of nodes for the pool. In
                regional or multi-zonal clusters, this is the number of nodes per zone. Changing
                this will force recreation of the resource. WARNING: Resizing your node pool manually
                may change this value in your existing cluster, which will trigger destruction
                and recreation on the next Terraform run (to rectify the discrepancy).  If you don't

            max_node_count: '- (Required) Maximum number of nodes in the NodePool. Must be >= min_node_count.'
            max_pods_per_node: |-
                - (Optional) The maximum number of pods per node in this node pool.
                Note that this does not work on node pools which are "route-based" - that is, node
                pools belonging to clusters that do not have IP Aliasing enabled.
                See the official documentation
                for more information.
            max_surge: |-
                - (Required) The number of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool during
                an upgrade. Increasing max_surge raises the number of nodes that can be upgraded simultaneously.
                Can be set to 0 or greater.
            max_unavailable: |-
                - (Required) The number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable during
                an upgrade. Increasing max_unavailable raises the number of nodes that can be upgraded in
                parallel. Can be set to 0 or greater.
            min_node_count: |-
                - (Required) Minimum number of nodes in the NodePool. Must be >=0 and
                <= max_node_count.
            name: |-
                - (Optional) The name of the node pool. If left blank, Terraform will
                auto-generate a unique name.
            name_prefix: |-
                - (Optional) Creates a unique name for the node pool beginning
                with the specified prefix. Conflicts with name.
            network_config: |-
                - (Optional) The network configuration of the pool. See
                google_container_cluster for schema.
            node_config: |-
                - (Optional) Parameters used in creating the node pool. See
                google_container_cluster for schema.
            node_count: |-
                - (Optional) The number of nodes per instance group. This field can be used to
                update the number of nodes per instance group but should not be used alongside autoscaling.
            node_locations: |-
                - (Optional)
                The list of zones in which the node pool's nodes should be located. Nodes must
                be in the region of their regional cluster or in the same region as their
                cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If unspecified, the cluster-level
                node_locations will be used.
            placement_policy: |-
                - (Optional, Beta) Specifies a custom placement policy for the
                nodes.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which to create the node pool. If blank,
                the provider-configured project will be used.
            type: |-
                - (Required) The type of the policy. Supports a single value: COMPACT.
                Specifying COMPACT placement policy type places node pool's nodes in a closer
                physical proximity in order to reduce network latency between nodes.
            update: '- (Default 30 minutes) Used for updates to node pools'
            upgrade_settings: |-
                (Optional) Specify node upgrade settings to change how many nodes GKE attempts to
                upgrade at once. The number of nodes upgraded simultaneously is the sum of max_surge and max_unavailable.
                The maximum number of nodes upgraded simultaneously is limited to 20. Structure is documented below.
            version: |-
                - (Optional) The Kubernetes version for the nodes in this pool. Note that if this field
                and auto_upgrade are both specified, they will fight each other for what the node version should
                be, so setting both is highly discouraged. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
                recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
                when fuzzy versions are used. See the google_container_engine_versions data source's
                version_prefix field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.

                Resources like Entry can have schemas associated with them. This scope allows users to attach tags to an
                individual column based on that schema.
                For attaching a tag to a nested column, use . to separate the column names. Example:
                outer_column.inner_column
            create: '- Default is 20 minutes.'
            delete: '- Default is 20 minutes.'

                Holds the value for a tag field with double type.
            enum_value: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Holds the value for a tag field with enum type. This value must be one of the allowed values in the definition of this enum.
                Structure is documented below.

                (Required)
                This maps the ID of a tag field to the value of and additional information about that field.
                Valid field IDs are defined by the tag's template. A tag must have at least 1 field and at most 500 fields.
                Structure is documented below.
            id: '- an identifier for the resource with format {{name}}'
            name: |-
                -
                The resource name of the tag in URL format. Example:
                projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/entrygroups/{entryGroupId}/entries/{entryId}/tags/{tag_id} or
                projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/entrygroups/{entryGroupId}/tags/{tag_id}
                where tag_id is a system-generated identifier. Note that this Tag may not actually be stored in the location in this name.
            order: |-
                -
                The order of this field with respect to other fields in this tag. For example, a higher value can indicate
                a more important field. The value can be negative. Multiple fields can have the same order, and field orders
                within a tag do not have to be sequential.
            parent: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The name of the parent this tag is attached to. This can be the name of an entry or an entry group. If an entry group, the tag will be attached to
                all entries in that group.
            string_value: |-
                -
                (Optional)

            crypto_replace_ffx_fpe_config: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Replaces an identifier with a surrogate using Format Preserving Encryption (FPE) with the FFX mode of operation; however when used in the content.reidentify API method, it serves the opposite function by reversing the surrogate back into the original identifier. The identifier must be encoded as ASCII. For a given crypto key and context, the same identifier will be replaced with the same surrogate. Identifiers must be at least two characters long. In the case that the identifier is the empty string, it will be skipped. See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/pseudonymization to learn more.
                Note: We recommend using CryptoDeterministicConfig for all use cases which do not require preserving the input alphabet space and size, plus warrant referential integrity.

                -
                (Optional)
                This is supported by mapping these to the alphanumeric characters that the FFX mode natively supports. This happens before/after encryption/decryption. Each character listed must appear only once. Number of characters must be in the range [2, 95]. This must be encoded as ASCII. The order of characters does not matter. The full list of allowed characters is:

            surrogate_info_type: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The custom infoType to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: info_type_name(surrogate_character_count):surrogate
                For example, if the name of custom infoType is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc'
                This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom infoType SurrogateType. This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.
                In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE

                (Required)
                Pattern defining the regular expression.
                Its syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub.
            proximity: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Proximity of the finding within which the entire hotword must reside. The total length of the window cannot
                exceed 1000 characters. Note that the finding itself will be included in the window, so that hotwords may be
                used to match substrings of the finding itself. For example, the certainty of a phone number regex
                (\d{3}) \d{3}-\d{4} could be adjusted upwards if the area code is known to be the local area code of a company
                office using the hotword regex (xxx), where xxx is the area code in question.
                Structure is documented below.
            regex: |-
                -

                -
                (Optional)
                Increase or decrease the likelihood by the specified number of levels. For example,
                if a finding would be POSSIBLE without the detection rule and relativeLikelihood is 1,
                then it is upgraded to LIKELY, while a value of -1 would downgrade it to UNLIKELY.
                Likelihood may never drop below VERY_UNLIKELY or exceed VERY_LIKELY, so applying an
                adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is VERY_LIKELY
                will result in a final likelihood of LIKELY. Either this or fixed_likelihood can be set.

                Maximum number of instances for this group. Note that by default, clusters will not use
                secondary workers. Required for secondary workers if the minimum secondary instances is set.

            scale_down_factor: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Fraction of average pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to
                remove workers. A scale-down factor of 1 will result in scaling down so that there
                is no available memory remaining after the update (more aggressive scaling).
                A scale-down factor of 0 disables removing workers, which can be beneficial for
                autoscaling a single job.
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0].
            scale_down_min_worker_fraction: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Minimum scale-down threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs.
                For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must
                recommend at least a 2 worker scale-down for the cluster to scale. A threshold of 0
                means the autoscaler will scale down on any recommended change.
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0]. Default: 0.0.
            scale_up_factor: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Fraction of average pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to
                add workers. A scale-up factor of 1.0 will result in scaling up so that there
                is no pending memory remaining after the update (more aggressive scaling).
                A scale-up factor closer to 0 will result in a smaller magnitude of scaling up
                (less aggressive scaling).
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0].
            scale_up_min_worker_fraction: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Minimum scale-up threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling
                occurs. For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler
                must recommend at least a 2-worker scale-up for the cluster to scale. A threshold of
                0 means the autoscaler will scale up on any recommended change.
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0]. Default: 0.0.
            secondary_worker_config: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Describes how the autoscaler will operate for secondary workers.
                Structure is documented below.
            update: '- Default is 20 minutes.'
            weight: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Weight for the instance group, which is used to determine the fraction of total workers
                in the cluster from this instance group. For example, if primary workers have weight 2,
                and secondary workers have weight 1, the cluster will have approximately 2 primary workers
                for each secondary worker.
                The cluster may not reach the specified balance if constrained by min/max bounds or other
                autoscaling settings. For example, if maxInstances for secondary workers is 0, then only
                primary workers will be added. The cluster can also be out of balance when created.
                If weight is not set on any instance group, the cluster will default to equal weight for
                all groups: the cluster will attempt to maintain an equal number of workers in each group
                within the configured size bounds for each group. If weight is set for one group only,
                the cluster will default to zero weight on the unset group. For example if weight is set
                only on primary workers, the cluster will use primary workers only and no secondary workers.

                the master and the worker nodes will be created in). If region is set to 'global' (default)
                then zone is mandatory, otherwise GCP is able to make use of Auto Zone Placement
                to determine this automatically for you.
                Note: This setting additionally determines and restricts
                which computing resources are available for use with other configs such as
                cluster_config.master_config.machine_type and cluster_config.worker_config.machine_type.

A typical update template flow would fetch the current template with a GetWorkflowTemplate request, which will return the current template with the version field filled in with the current server version. The user updates other fields in the template, then returns it as part of the UpdateWorkflowTemplate request.

                deployment. It can be updated to false to actually deploy
                with real resources.
                ~>NOTE: Deployment Manager does not allow update
                of a deployment in preview (unless updating to preview=false). Thus,
                Terraform will force-recreate deployments if either preview is updated
                to true or if other fields are updated while preview is true.

                (Optional)
                To filter out false positive results and still get variety in matched natural language inputs for your agent, you can tune the machine learning classification threshold.
                If the returned score value is less than the threshold value, then a no-match event will be triggered. The score values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). If set to 0.0, the default of 0.3 is used.

                A flow's event handlers serve two purposes:
                They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match, webhook errors) in the flow.
                They are inherited by every page's [event handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
                Unlike transitionRoutes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.

                Whether Dialogflow should return currently queued fulfillment response messages in streaming APIs. If a webhook is specified, it happens before Dialogflow invokes webhook. Warning: 1) This flag only affects streaming API. Responses are still queued and returned once in non-streaming API. 2) The flag can be enabled in any fulfillment but only the first 3 partial responses will be returned. You may only want to apply it to fulfillments that have slow webhooks.

                The key/value metadata to label an intent. Labels can contain lowercase letters, digits and the symbols '-' and '_'. International characters are allowed, including letters from unicase alphabets. Keys must start with a letter. Keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters and no more than 128 bytes.
                Prefix "sys-" is reserved for Dialogflow defined labels. Currently allowed Dialogflow defined labels include: * sys-head * sys-contextual The above labels do not require value. "sys-head" means the intent is a head intent. "sys.contextual" means the intent is a contextual intent.
                An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

                -
                (Required)
                The ordered list of training phrase parts. The parts are concatenated in order to form the training phrase.
                Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does.
                Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated.
                If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set.
                If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways:
                Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters.
                Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the parameterId field is set.
                Structure is documented below.
            priority: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The priority of this intent. Higher numbers represent higher priorities.
                If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the Normal priority in the console.
                If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests.
            redact: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates whether the parameter content should be redacted in log. If redaction is enabled, the parameter content will be replaced by parameter name during logging.
                Note: the parameter content is subject to redaction if either parameter level redaction or entity type level redaction is enabled.

                Whether Dialogflow should return currently queued fulfillment response messages in streaming APIs. If a webhook is specified, it happens before Dialogflow invokes webhook. Warning: 1) This flag only affects streaming API. Responses are still queued and returned once in non-streaming API. 2) The flag can be enabled in any fulfillment but only the first 3 partial responses will be returned. You may only want to apply it to fulfillments that have slow webhooks.
            tag: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                Specifies whether this is a key signing key (KSK) or a zone
                signing key (ZSK). Key signing keys have the Secure Entry
                Point flag set and, when active, will only be used to sign
                resource record sets of type DNSKEY. Zone signing keys do
                not have the Secure Entry Point flag set and will be used
                to sign all other types of resource record sets.
                Possible values are keySigning and zoneSigning.

            disable_referential_integrity: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store
                creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API will enforce referential integrity and fail the
                requests that will result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API
                will skip referential integrity check. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as
                Patient.get$everything, will not return all the results if broken references exist.
                ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **
            disable_resource_versioning: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation
                of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations will cause historical
                versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but
                cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions will be kept. The server will send back errors for
                attempts to read the historical versions.
                ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **
            enable_history_import: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Whether to allow the bulk import API to accept history bundles and directly insert historical resource
                versions into the FHIR store. Importing resource histories creates resource interactions that appear to have
                occurred in the past, which clients may not want to allow. If set to false, history bundles within an import
                will fail with an error.
                ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **
                ** This property can be changed manually in the Google Cloud Healthcare admin console without recreating the FHIR store **
            enable_update_create: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Whether this FHIR store has the updateCreate capability. This determines if the client can use an Update
                operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through
                the Create operation and attempts to Update a non-existent resource will return errors. Please treat the audit
                logs with appropriate levels of care if client-specified resource IDs contain sensitive data such as patient
                identifiers, those IDs will be part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Cloud Pub/Sub
                notifications.

            pubsub_topic: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The Cloud Pub/Sub topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client.
                PubsubMessage.Data will contain the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message.
                It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message
                was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. Topic names must be scoped to a
                project. service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-healthcare.iam.gserviceaccount.com must have publisher permissions on the given
                Cloud Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions will cause the calls that send notifications to fail.
            recursive_structure_depth: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The depth for all recursive structures in the output analytics schema. For example, concept in the CodeSystem
                resource is a recursive structure; when the depth is 2, the CodeSystem table will have a column called
                concept.concept but not concept.concept.concept. If not specified or set to 0, the server will use the default
                value 2. The maximum depth allowed is 5.
            resource_types: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Supply a FHIR resource type (such as "Patient" or "Observation"). See
                https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-resource-types.html for a list of all FHIR resource types. The server treats
                an empty list as an intent to stream all the supported resource types in this FHIR store.
            schema_config: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The configuration for the exported BigQuery schema.
                Structure is documented below.
            schema_type: |-

            stream_configs: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in
                this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next
                resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed
                from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required
                bigquery.dataEditor role to your project's Cloud Healthcare Service Agent service account. Some lag (typically on
                the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
                Structure is documented below.

                Acceptable values for the aud field (audience) in the OIDC token. Token exchange
                requests are rejected if the token audience does not match one of the configured
                values. Each audience may be at most 256 characters. A maximum of 10 audiences may
                be configured.
                If this list is empty, the OIDC token audience must be equal to the full canonical
                resource name of the WorkloadIdentityPoolProvider, with or without the HTTPS prefix.
                For example:
            assertion: ': JSON representing the authentication credential issued by the provider.'
            attribute: |-
                : The custom attributes mapped from the assertion in the attribute_mappings.
                The maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096 characters. If
                unspecified, all valid authentication credential are accepted.
                The following example shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped google.groups
                value of admins:
            attribute.{custom_attribute}: |-
                :
                principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}
                Each value must be a Common Expression Language
                function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified
                by the corresponding map key.
                You can use the assertion keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of
                the authentication credential issued by the provider.
                The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated,
                the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB.
                For AWS providers, the following rules apply:
            attribute_condition: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A Common Expression Language expression, in
                plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid authentication credentials issued by the
                provider should not be accepted.
                The expression must output a boolean representing whether to allow the federation.
                The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions:
            attribute_mapping: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Maps attributes from authentication credentials issued by an external identity provider
                to Google Cloud attributes, such as subject and segment.
                Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to.
                The following keys are supported:
            aws: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                A valueExtractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to
                record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction - EXTRACT(field) or
                REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument are 1. field - The name of the log entry field from which
                the value is to be extracted. 2. regex - A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax
                (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified
                log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an

                functions may be applied to all
                time series, depending on the
                metric type and the value type of
                the original time series.
                Reduction may change the metric
                type of value type of the time
                series.Time series data must be
                aligned in order to perform cross-
                time series reduction. If
                crossSeriesReducer is specified,

                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the alignment of data points in
                individual time series selected by
                denominatorFilter as well as how to combine
                the retrieved time series together (such as
                when aggregating multiple streams on each
                resource to a single stream for each
                resource or when aggregating streams across
                all members of a group of resources).When
                computing ratios, the aggregations and
                denominator_aggregations fields must use the
                same alignment period and produce time
                series that have the same periodicity and
                labels.This field is similar to the one in
                the MetricService.ListTimeSeries request. It
                is advisable to use the ListTimeSeries
                method when debugging this field.

            denominator_filter: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A filter that identifies a time series that
                should be used as the denominator of a ratio
                that will be compared with the threshold. If
                a denominator_filter is specified, the time
                series specified by the filter field will be
                used as the numerator.The filter is similar
                to the one that is specified in the
                MetricService.ListTimeSeries request (that
                call is useful to verify the time series
                that will be retrieved / processed) and must
                specify the metric type and optionally may
                contain restrictions on resource type,
                resource labels, and metric labels. This
                field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters

                condition in dashboards, notifications, and
                incidents. To avoid confusion, don't use the same
                display name for multiple conditions in the same
                policy.
            documentation: |-
                -

                Documentation that is included with notifications and incidents related
                to this policy. Best practice is for the documentation to include information
                to help responders understand, mitigate, escalate, and correct the underlying
                problems detected by the alerting policy. Notification channels that have
                limited capacity might not show this documentation.
                Structure is documented below.
            duration: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The amount of time that a time series must
                violate the threshold to be considered
                failing. Currently, only values that are a
                multiple of a minute--e.g., 0, 60, 120, or
                300 seconds--are supported. If an invalid
                value is given, an error will be returned.
                When choosing a duration, it is useful to
                keep in mind the frequency of the underlying
                time series data (which may also be affected
                by any alignments specified in the
                aggregations field); a good duration is long
                enough so that a single outlier does not
                generate spurious alerts, but short enough
                that unhealthy states are detected and
                alerted on quickly.
            enabled: |-
                -

            group_by_fields: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The set of fields to preserve when
                crossSeriesReducer is specified.
                The groupByFields determine how
                the time series are partitioned
                into subsets prior to applying the
                aggregation function. Each subset
                contains time series that have the
                same value for each of the
                grouping fields. Each individual
                time series is a member of exactly
                one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
                is applied to each subset of time
                series. It is not possible to
                reduce across different resource
                types, so this field implicitly
                contains resource.type. Fields not
                specified in groupByFields are
                aggregated away. If groupByFields
                is not specified and all the time
                series have the same resource
                type, then the time series are
                aggregated into a single output
                time series. If crossSeriesReducer
                is not defined, this field is
                ignored.

                A map from a label key to an extractor expression, which is used to
                extract the value for this label key. Each entry in this map is
                a specification for how data should be extracted from log entries that
                match filter. Each combination of extracted values is treated as
                a separate rule for the purposes of triggering notifications.
                Label keys and corresponding values can be used in notifications
                generated by this condition.

                sent when incidents are opened or closed or when new violations occur
                on an already opened incident. Each element of this array corresponds

                Alignment may change the metric
                type or the value type of the time
                series.Time series data must be

                The launch stage of the metric definition.
                Possible values are LAUNCH_STAGE_UNSPECIFIED, UNIMPLEMENTED, PRELAUNCH, EARLY_ACCESS, ALPHA, BETA, GA, and DEPRECATED.
            metadata: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Metadata which can be used to guide usage of the metric.
                Structure is documented below.
            metric_kind: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Whether the metric records instantaneous values, changes to a value, etc. Some combinations of metricKind and valueType might not be supported.
                Possible values are METRIC_KIND_UNSPECIFIED, GAUGE, DELTA, and CUMULATIVE.
            monitored_resource_types: |-
                -
                If present, then a time series, which is identified partially by a metric type and a MonitoredResourceDescriptor, that is associated with this metric type can only be associated with one of the monitored resource types listed here. This field allows time series to be associated with the intersection of this metric type and the monitored resource types in this list.
            name: |-
                -
                The resource name of the metric descriptor.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            sample_period: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The sampling period of metric data points. For metrics which are written periodically, consecutive data points are stored at this time interval, excluding data loss due to errors. Metrics with a higher granularity have a smaller sampling period. In [duration format](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf?&_ga=2.264881487.1507873253.1593446723-935052455.1591817775#google.protobuf.Duration).
            type: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not URL-encoded. All service defined metrics must be prefixed with the service name, in the format of {service name}/{relative metric name}, such as cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/cpu/utilization. The relative metric name must have only upper and lower-case letters, digits, '/' and underscores '_' are allowed. Additionally, the maximum number of characters allowed for the relative_metric_name is 100. All user-defined metric types have the DNS name custom.googleapis.com, external.googleapis.com, or logging.googleapis.com/user/.
            unit: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the
                valueType is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of
                the stored metric values.
                Different systems may scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of
                0.02KBy might be displayed as 20By, and a value of 3523KBy might be displayed as
                3.5MBy). However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is always in
                thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed.
                If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job,
                you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently
                1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as
                12005.
                Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you
                can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value
                12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).
                The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure standard.
                More info can be found in the API documentation
                (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors).

                The type of data that can be assigned to the label.
                Default value is STRING.
                Possible values are STRING, BOOL, and INT64.

                NotificationChannelDescriptor corresponding to the type field.
                Labels with sensitive data are obfuscated by the API and therefore Terraform cannot

                Different notification type behaviors are configured primarily using the the labels field on this
                resource. This block contains the labels which contain secrets or passwords so that they can be marked
                sensitive and hidden from plan output. The name of the field, eg: password, will be the key
                in the labels map in the api request.
                Credentials may not be specified in both locations and will cause an error. Changing from one location
                to a different credential configuration in the config will require an apply to update state.

This field is intended to be used for organizing and identifying the NotificationChannel objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.
            verification_status: |-
                -
                Indicates whether this channel has been verified or not. On a ListNotificationChannels or GetNotificationChannel operation, this field is expected to be populated.If the value is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning (it both requires verification and lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed that the channel works.If the channel is neither VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it implies that the channel is of a type that does not require verification or that this specific channel has been exempted from verification because it was created prior to verification being required for channels of this type.This field cannot be modified using a standard UpdateNotificationChannel operation. To change the value of this field, you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.

                Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.
                You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
                Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
                destination location.
                Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
                location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
                endpoint from route information.
                If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
                multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
                destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
                interface.
                A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
                is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
                don't intend to test.

                -
                (Optional)
                The IP protocol port of the endpoint. Only applicable when
                protocol is TCP or UDP.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.

                -
                (Optional)
                Project ID where the endpoint is located. The Project ID can be
                derived from the URI if you provide a VM instance or network URI.
                The following are two cases where you must provide the project ID:
            protocol: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                IP Protocol of the test. When not provided, "TCP" is assumed.
            related_projects: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Other projects that may be relevant for reachability analysis.
                This is applicable to scenarios where a test can cross project
                boundaries.
            source: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.
                You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
                (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
                source location.
                Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
                a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
                also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
                which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
                information.
                If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
                you must provide the destination VPC network.
                If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
                network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
                identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
                address or VPC network.
                A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
                ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
                you don't intend to test.

                (Optional)
                The maximum number of attempts to cache fill from this origin. Another attempt is made when a cache fill fails with one of the retryConditions.
                Once maxAttempts to this origin have failed the failoverOrigin will be used, if one is specified. That failoverOrigin may specify its own maxAttempts,
                retryConditions and failoverOrigin to control its own cache fill failures.
                The total number of allowed attempts to cache fill across this and failover origins is limited to four.
                The total time allowed for cache fill attempts across this and failover origins can be controlled with maxAttemptsTimeout.

                The maximum time across all connection attempts to the origin, including failover origins, before returning an error to the client. A HTTP 504 will be returned if the timeout is reached before a response is returned.
                Defaults to 15 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s.
                If a failoverOrigin is specified, the maxAttemptsTimeout of the first configured origin sets the deadline for all connection attempts across all failoverOrigins.

                The name must be 1-64 characters long, and match the regular expression [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]* which means the first character must be a letter,
                and all following characters must be a dash, underscore, letter or digit.
            origin_address: |-
                -
                (Required)
                A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address reachable over the public Internet, or the address of a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
                This address will be used as the origin for cache requests - e.g. FQDN: media-backend.example.com, IPv4: 35.218.1.1, IPv6: 2607:f8b0:4012:809::200e, Cloud Storage: gs://bucketname
                When providing an FQDN (hostname), it must be publicly resolvable (e.g. via Google public DNS) and IP addresses must be publicly routable.  It must not contain a protocol (e.g., https://) and it must not contain any slashes.
                If a Cloud Storage bucket is provided, it must be in the canonical "gs://bucketname" format. Other forms, such as "storage.googleapis.com", will be rejected.
            port: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The port to connect to the origin on.
                Defaults to port 443 for HTTP2 and HTTPS protocols, and port 80 for HTTP.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.

                -
                (Optional)
                The protocol to use to connect to the configured origin. Defaults to HTTP2, and it is strongly recommended that users use HTTP2 for both security & performance.
                When using HTTP2 or HTTPS as the protocol, a valid, publicly-signed, unexpired TLS (SSL) certificate must be presented by the origin server.
                Possible values are HTTP2, HTTPS, and HTTP.
            read_timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum duration to wait between reads of a single HTTP connection/stream.
                Defaults to 15 seconds.  The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s.
                The readTimeout is capped by the responseTimeout.  All reads of the HTTP connection/stream must be completed by the deadline set by the responseTimeout.
                If the response headers have already been written to the connection, the response will be truncated and logged.
            response_timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum duration to wait for the last byte of a response to arrive when reading from the HTTP connection/stream.
                Defaults to 30 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 120s.
                The responseTimeout starts after the connection has been established.
                This also applies to HTTP Chunked Transfer Encoding responses, and/or when an open-ended Range request is made to the origin. Origins that take longer to write additional bytes to the response than the configured responseTimeout will result in an error being returned to the client.
                If the response headers have already been written to the connection, the response will be truncated and logged.
            retry_conditions: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies one or more retry conditions for the configured origin.
                If the failure mode during a connection attempt to the origin matches the configured retryCondition(s),
                the origin request will be retried up to maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if configured, will then be used to satisfy the request.
                The default retryCondition is "CONNECT_FAILURE".
                retryConditions apply to this origin, and not subsequent failoverOrigin(s),
                which may specify their own retryConditions and maxAttempts.
                Valid values are:

                Hosts are matched against the HTTP Host header, or for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the ":authority" header, from the incoming request.
                You may specify up to 10 hosts.

                -
                (Optional)
                Defines the request parameters that contribute to the cache key.
                Structure is documented below.
            cache_mode: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Cache modes allow users to control the behaviour of the cache, what content it should cache automatically, whether to respect origin headers, or whether to unconditionally cache all responses.
                For all cache modes, Cache-Control headers will be passed to the client. Use clientTtl to override what is sent to the client.
                Possible values are CACHE_ALL_STATIC, USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, FORCE_CACHE_ALL, and BYPASS_CACHE.
            cdn_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                Structure is documented below.
            client_ttl: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) TTL, separate from the TTL used by the edge caches. Leaving this empty will use the same cache TTL for both the CDN and the client-facing response.

                -
                (Optional)
                Disables HTTP/2.
                HTTP/2 (h2) is enabled by default and recommended for performance. HTTP/2 improves connection re-use and reduces connection setup overhead by sending multiple streams over the same connection.
                Some legacy HTTP clients may have issues with HTTP/2 connections due to broken HTTP/2 implementations. Setting this to true will prevent HTTP/2 from being advertised and negotiated.
            disable_quic: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                HTTP/3 (IETF QUIC) and Google QUIC are enabled by default.
            disabled: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If true, specifies the CORS policy is disabled. The default value is false, which indicates that the CORS policy is in effect.

                -
                (Optional)
                Resource URL that points at the Cloud Armor edge security policy that is applied on each request against the EdgeCacheService.
            edge_ssl_certificates: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                URLs to sslCertificate resources that are used to authenticate connections between users and the EdgeCacheService.
                Note that only "global" certificates with a "scope" of "EDGE_CACHE" can be attached to an EdgeCacheService.
            enable: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Specifies whether to enable logging for traffic served by this service.
            exact_match: |-
                -

            exclude_host: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If true, requests to different hosts will be cached separately.
                Note: this should only be enabled if hosts share the same origin and content. Removing the host from the cache key may inadvertently result in different objects being cached than intended, depending on which route the first user matched.
            exclude_query_string: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If true, exclude query string parameters from the cache key
                If false (the default), include the query string parameters in
                the cache key according to includeQueryParameters and
                excludeQueryParameters. If neither includeQueryParameters nor
                excludeQueryParameters is set, the entire query string will be
                included.
            excluded_query_parameters: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                -
                (Optional)
                For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the request must exactly match the value specified in fullPathMatch after removing any query parameters and anchor that may be part of the original URL.
            header_action: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The header actions, including adding & removing headers, for requests that match this route.
                Structure is documented below.

                (Required)
                Headers to remove from the response prior to sending it back to the client.
                Response headers are only sent to the client, and do not have an effect on the cache serving the response.

                -
                (Required)
                The value of the header to add.

                -
                (Optional)
                The host that will be used in the redirect response instead of the one that was supplied in the request.
            host_rewrite: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Prior to forwarding the request to the selected origin, the request's host header is replaced with contents of hostRewrite.
            host_rule: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The list of hostRules to match against. These rules define which hostnames the EdgeCacheService will match against, and which route configurations apply.

                of the original URL.
                pathTemplateMatch must be between 1 and 255 characters
                (inclusive).  The pattern specified by pathTemplateMatch may

                pathTemplateRewrite must be between 1 and 255 characters
                (inclusive), must start with a '/', and must only use variables
                captured by the route's pathTemplate matchers.
                pathTemplateRewrite may only be used when all of a route's

                You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 1 and 999 inclusive.
                Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers
                to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.

                Enables monitoring and attestation of the boot integrity of
                the instance. The attestation is performed against the
                integrity policy baseline. This baseline is initially derived
                from the implicitly trusted boot image when the instance is
                created. Enabled by default.

                (Optional)
                A condition which determines whether this rule is used in the evaluation of the policy. When set, the expression field in the `Expr' must include from 1 to 10 subexpressions, joined by the "||" or "&&" operators. Each subexpression must be of the form "resource.matchTag('/tag_key_short_name, 'tag_value_short_name')". or "resource.matchTagId('tagKeys/key_id', 'tagValues/value_id')". where key_name and value_name are the resource names for Label Keys and Values. These names are available from the Tag Manager Service. An example expression is: "resource.matchTag('123456789/environment, 'prod')". or "resource.matchTagId('tagKeys/123', 'tagValues/456')".

                -
                (Optional)
                If true, then the Policy is enforced. If false, then any configuration is acceptable. This field can be set only in Policies for boolean constraints.
            etag: |-
                -
                An opaque tag indicating the current version of the Policy, used for concurrency control. This field is ignored if used in a CreatePolicy request. When the Policy is returned from either a GetPolicy or a ListPolicies request, this etag indicates the version of the current Policy to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the Policy is returned from a GetEffectivePolicy request, the etag will be unset.
            expression: |-

                -
                (Optional)
                Determines the inheritance behavior for this Policy. If inherit_from_parent is true, PolicyRules set higher up in the hierarchy (up to the closest root) are inherited and present in the effective policy. If it is false, then no rules are inherited, and this Policy becomes the new root for evaluation. This field can be set only for Policies which configure list constraints.
            location: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.

Must be one of the following forms, where constraint_name is the name of the constraint which this Policy configures: * projects/{project_number}/policies/{constraint_name} * folders/{folder_id}/policies/{constraint_name} * organizations/{organization_id}/policies/{constraint_name} For example, "projects/123/policies/compute.disableSerialPortAccess". Note: projects/{project_id}/policies/{constraint_name} is also an acceptable name for API requests, but responses will return the name using the equivalent project number.
            parent: |-
                -

                Ignores policies set above this resource and restores the constraint_default enforcement behavior of the specific Constraint at this resource. This field can be set in policies for either list or boolean constraints. If set, rules must be empty and inherit_from_parent must be set to false.
            rules: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Up to 10 PolicyRules are allowed. In Policies for boolean constraints, the following requirements apply: - There must be one and only one PolicyRule where condition is unset. - BooleanPolicyRules with conditions must set enforced to the opposite of the PolicyRule without a condition. - During policy evaluation, PolicyRules with conditions that are true for a target resource take precedence.

            disruption_budget: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The maximum number (or percentage) of VMs per zone to disrupt at any given moment. The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up.
                During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps.
                A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget.
                For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone.
                For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of 10, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops.
                Structure is documented below.

                -
                (Optional)
                This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
                before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
                delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
                acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
                again during that time (on a best-effort basis).
                For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
                the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
                subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
                pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
                maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
                If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.
                For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
                for the call to the push endpoint.
                If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
                will eventually redeliver the message.
            attributes: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Endpoint configuration attributes.
                Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
                be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.
                The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
                can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
                attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
                the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
                (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
                based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.
                If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
                it will default to the version of the API used to make
                such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
                call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
                calls will always return a valid version, even if the
                subscription was created without this attribute.
                The possible values for this attribute are:
            audience: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. The audience claim
                identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. The audience
                value is a single case-sensitive string. Having multiple values (array)
                for the audience field is not supported. More info about the OIDC JWT
                token audience here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3
                Note: if not specified, the Push endpoint URL will be used.

            dead_letter_policy: |-
                -

                A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in
                this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering
                is disabled.
                The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscription's
                parent project (i.e.,
                service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
                permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.
                Structure is documented below.
            dead_letter_topic: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The name of the topic to which dead letter messages should be published.
                Format is projects/{project}/topics/{topic}.
                The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with the enclosing subscription's
                parent project (i.e.,
                service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
                permission to Publish() to this topic.
                The operation will fail if the topic does not exist.
                Users should ensure that there is a subscription attached to this topic
                since messages published to a topic with no subscriptions are lost.
            delete: '- Default is 20 minutes.'
            enable_exactly_once_delivery: is true if the message was published multiple times by a publisher client. These copies are considered distinct by Pub/Sub and have distinct messageId values
            enable_message_ordering: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If true, messages published with the same orderingKey in PubsubMessage will be delivered to
                the subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they
                may be delivered in any order.
            expiration_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration.
                A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber
                is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing
                operations on the subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default
                policy with ttl of 31 days will be used.  If it is set but ttl is "", the
                resource never expires.  The minimum allowed value for expirationPolicy.ttl
                is 1 day.
                Structure is documented below.
            filter: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The subscription only delivers the messages that match the filter.
                Pub/Sub automatically acknowledges the messages that don't match the filter. You can filter messages
                by their attributes. The maximum length of a filter is 256 bytes. After creating the subscription,
                you can't modify the filter.

                -
                (Optional)
                A set of key/value label pairs to assign to this Subscription.
            max_delivery_attempts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum number of delivery attempts for any message. The value must be
                between 5 and 100.
                The number of delivery attempts is defined as 1 + (the sum of number of
                NACKs and number of times the acknowledgement deadline has been exceeded for the message).
                A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. Note that
                client libraries may automatically extend ack_deadlines.
                This field will be honored on a best effort basis.
                If this parameter is 0, a default value of 5 is used.
            maximum_backoff: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 600 seconds.
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: "3.5s".
            message_retention_duration: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
                backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
                retain_acked_messages is true, then this also configures the retention
                of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a
                subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more
                than 7 days ("604800s") or less than 10 minutes ("600s").
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated
                by 's'. Example: "600.5s".

                -
                (Optional)
                If specified, Pub/Sub will generate and attach an OIDC JWT token as
                an Authorization header in the HTTP request for every pushed message.
                Structure is documented below.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.

                (Optional)
                If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to
                configure it. An empty pushConfig signifies that the subscriber will
                pull and ack messages using API methods.
                Structure is documented below.
            push_endpoint: |-

                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then
                messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if
                they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
                messageRetentionDuration window.
            retry_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription.
                If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers.
                RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message
                Structure is documented below.
